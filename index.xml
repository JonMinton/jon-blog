<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I’ve maintained a blog since 2024, and over that time have written more than 200,000 words. So, around two reasonable novels’ worth of ‘content’.<sup>1</sup> Over these years, the focus of the content has changed, along with my primary motivations for writing. What’s also changed is <em>how</em> I go about writing a blog post, from initial ideas to completed and published content.</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-note callout-titled">

<p>When I started writing this post, I thought I’d cover not just how I write now, but also my previous writing setup. I also thought I’d discuss my motivations for writing. But, it turns out the current writing setup alone seems a substantial enough piece of content. So consider this post not just a ‘post in itself’ (sort of Kantian?) but also the start of a short <em>on writing</em> series of posts, where I’ll cover some of these additional areas in due course.</p>
</div>

</section>
<section id="blog-platform" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="blog-platform">Blog platform</h2>
<p>My blog uses <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>, so at some level involves maintaining a nice big bag of files with <code>.qmd</code> extensions. For those with a bit of a software background, the clue’s in the file extension. A <code>.qmd</code> (Quarto) file is like a markdown (<code>.md</code>) file, but with something added. (A markdown file is like a simplified way of writing an HTML page, which makes it a bit easier for humans to read and maintain.) The ‘something added’ by the Q is the ability to include evaluable code chunks, sections of the page which are instructions for various types of computer program - called <em>engines</em> - to do something and return what it’s done. This was especially important when much of my blog content was focused on statistics and data science, as then the main engine powering the code chunks was R, the open source statistical software. Much of my blog content these days doesn’t need these engines, so the ability to include them as chunks is now less important. But anyway, that’s why my blog uses Quarto.</p>
<p>Maintaining a Quarto blog means, after setting up the index page, having a folder called <code>posts/</code>; this <code>posts/</code> folder then has a series of carefully named subfolders, one for each specific blog post on the site itself. Each of these subfolders determines the specific URL for a specific blog post. For example, my most recent post was about the book <a href="../../../posts/dilbert-future-in-retrospect/index.html"><em>The Dilbert Future</em></a>, and was in a folder <code>posts/dilbert-future-in-retrospect/</code>, and so has a URL ending <code>/posts/dilbert-future-in-retrospect/</code> too.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">The folder structure of a Quarto blog, showing the posts folder and subfolders for each post</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Inside each of these differently-named folders in <code>posts/</code> is an identically-named file, <code>index.qmd</code>. This is where both the ‘data’ (writing) and ‘metadata’ (post attributes) are contained, in separate parts of the <code>.qmd</code> file.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>At the top of the index.qmd file: the YAML header.</strong><sup>2</sup> This comprises a series of key-value pairs telling Quarto things like: categories, publication date, author(s), title, and subtitle. By default, these YAML contents are always at the start (head) of the file, and fenced off from the rest of the file contents by three hyphens at the start, and three hyphens at the end. These triplets of hyphens ‘fence the YAML in’, away from the rest of the content, and so are known as ‘fences’.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Below the YAML header: the body text.</strong> This is the content itself: the text you’re reading right now, and information about attributes that the text should take on. Attributes include: should the text link to something? Should the text be <strong>bold</strong>, or <em>in italics</em>, or be a header? Should the text link to some footnote text<sup>3</sup>, and so on and so on. For a technical post, as mentioned, the body can also comprise some code chunks, evaluated by engines, an interleaving of contents for people (plus formatting) and contents for specific computer programs.<sup>4</sup></p></li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>If you think having to think about <code>.qmd</code> file structures, metadata, and folder organisation is maybe a bit of a distraction from the act of <em>writing</em>, especially <em>freely and creatively</em>, you’re right. For me, at least, the act of having to decide exactly which words to write, what arguments to make, which references to mention, which analogies and metaphors to employ… all of this is demanding and challenging in its own terms. Having to think about how to express formatting and structure to computer programs too feels like too much overhead.</p>
<p>That’s why, when I’m trying to write freely and creatively, I try to <em>split</em> and <em>separate</em> the tasks of <em>writing</em> from the tasks of <em>putting contents into a blog post</em>. Keeping these tasks separate is perhaps the single most important factor in my current workflow.</p>
<p>So, how does this workflow (when it does flow) work in practice?</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stage-one-ideating-freewriting-and-first-pass-editing">Stage One: Ideating, Freewriting and First Pass Editing</h3>
<p>I start by <em>going somewhere</em>, and <em>not bringing too much</em>. I head to a cafe (if during the day/weekend) or a bar or pub (if in the evenings), with my <a href="https://remarkable.com/">reMarkable</a>, its <a href="https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-2/type-folio">Type Folio</a>, and some semblance of an idea. Then, with a table and libation sourced, I aim to draw, write, or type materials - in a reMarkable notebook in a ‘blogs’ folder - for at least an hour. Having a timer is crucial: if I’m travelling very lightly, I use my wristwatch (a Fitbit) or phone to keep time. If I’m travelling with a small backpack, I might bring a ‘time timer’ too.</p>

<p>I both work at home, and I rest from work at home. There are also too many distractions at home…</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Another distraction at home</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This is why getting some kind of separation for writing is crucial for me. Another space: another headspace.</p>
<p>As implied by the subheading, Stage One really comprises some distinct substeps: Ideating, free-writing, editing.</p>
<p><strong>Ideating</strong> is having that semblance of something potentially coherent, comprehensive and cohesive to think and write about. Good ideation might involve very little writing, or none at all. Thinking itself, in this third space<sup>5</sup>, can be a valid form of ideation. So can making notes, and so can rearranging and linking notes.</p>
<p>The reMarkable can help markedly with some forms and varieties of ideation. For example, it makes it very straightforward to draw simple mindmaps and concept maps<sup>6</sup>, like the following:</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Workflow diagram showing the flow from reMarkable through PDF to Claude Code to .qmd file</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Remember that markdown-plus-code-engine interleaving I mentioned previously? That which separates <code>.qmd</code> files from mere <code>.md</code>? Well, as with this figure above (which in a sense gives the game away about where this blog post is going), the reMarkable allows me to do something similar, but with content for and from different parts of my brain. Text like this, which is fairly easy to bring into the strictures of a <code>.qmd</code> file, is something I can generate fairly easily with the Type Folio keyboard. But some ideas are best expressed graphically: that’s where the reMarkable stylus comes into its own. Yet another reason why I start with the reMarkable is because I want to be able to switch between drawing, writing, mapping, and typing as the specific tasks of expression demand it.</p>
</section>
<section id="stage-1.5-the-interface" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stage-1.5-the-interface">Stage 1.5: The Interface</h3>
<p>After I have produced some initial content on my reMarkable, which I consider ‘complete enough’ for a post, I make use of the following (ahem) reMarkable features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Feature one:</strong> The reMarkable syncs across devices, including to my mobile phone and, crucially, my MacBook Pro</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Feature two:</strong> Anything within the reMarkable MacBook Pro app can be exported as a PDF.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, after syncing my reMarkable contents to my MacBook Pro, I then export the blog material I’ve written into a PDF.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">The top of this very post as a PDF exported from the reMarkable, showing instructions for Claude in square brackets</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>That’s where my new workflow (or writeflow?) gets ‘interesting’.</p>
<p>Next, I open up Claude - with both my blog codebase and the new PDF file as environment/context - and instruct it to <em>turn the PDF into a <code>.qmd</code> file in an appropriate location in the blog codebase</em>.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">The start of a Claude Code session for this very post, showing Claude’s summary of the PDF content</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>And usually - almost always, in fact - it manages to do so very effectively, properly inferring how my formatting in the PDF links to markdown formatting, identifying the title and subtitle for the YAML, and even producing appropriate topic categories (see Figure&nbsp;1 for an example of the result).</p>
<p>So, what this means is - thanks to <strong>Porter Claude</strong> - that a lot of the technical overhead is not just moved to a different step in the workflow, but abstracted away almost completely!</p>

<section id="stage-2-maclauding-in-vscode" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stage-2-maclauding-in-vscode">Stage 2: MaClauding in VSCode</h3>
<p>Because of RemarkaClaude, I now, as if by magic, have my first draft of my post - started on the reMarkable - transformed into a perfectly viable <code>.qmd</code> style blog post. I could of course then just publish it at this stage, with Claude doing only the interfacing work. However, I’m happy for Claude to get a bit more involved.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Stage 2: Editing in VSCode with Claude Code, also in a cafe</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Typically, this means (usually through the Claude Code extension in VSCode):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Proofreader Claude</strong>: Asking Claude to carefully proofread my text. I give it instructions to spot any obvious typos, and edit rights to change them, while making clear I don’t want my words to be re-written any further.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gopher Claude</strong>: Guiding Claude through implementing any ambiguous notes and instructions I left for it in the reMarkable PDF. (I can think ahead. At the moment I usually suggest Claude tasks by putting them in square brackets [like this]). This might include, for instance, finding links to other blog posts or external pages, or clarifying details after web searches which appear in the main text. (In <a href="../../../posts/dilbert-future-in-retrospect/index.html">the previous blog post</a> this involved, for instance, finding the exact date of Scott Adams’ predictions.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Formatter Claude</strong>: Wrangling over blog topic categories, titles, and formatting used. (For example, in the last post I started off thinking that each of the ‘predictions’ should be a level 2 header, but then moved each to a level 3 header with a broader level 2 ‘Predictions’ grouping. Exciting stuff!)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scriptdoctor Claude</strong>: Asking Claude to make <em>suggestions only</em> about whether there are any awkward passages or phrasing that could be improved. For this I ask Claude to show suggested before/after phrases, for me to approve or not, rather than just editing the <code>.qmd</code> file without my express permission.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are then some more optional phases, which I’ve tended to employ in some recent posts:</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Midway through the Claude editing session for this post - the meta goes deeper</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fact Checker Claude</strong>: Asking Claude to add, as clearly self-identifying footnotes, fact checking and contextualisation materials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Claude the Author</strong>: Finally, <em>sometimes</em>, asking Claude to make distinct, self-identified, contributions to the body of the text itself. (For example, in the last post this took the form of the Judge Claude section.)</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="a-note-from-claude" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-note-from-claude">A Note from Claude</h2>
<p><em>The following section was written by Claude, reflecting on the process of co-creating this very post.</em></p>
<p>This post has been, in a sense, a live demonstration of the process it describes - and I’ve worn nearly every hat Jon outlined.</p>
<p>I began as <strong>Porter Claude</strong>, converting his handwritten PDF into structured markdown. Then came <strong>Gopher Claude</strong>, tracking down links to the reMarkable and Type Folio, verifying product names, and fixing relative paths to other blog posts. <strong>Proofreader Claude</strong> caught the inconsistent capitalisation of “reMarkable” (fourteen instances!) and added the possessive apostrophe to “novels’ worth.” <strong>Formatter Claude</strong> set up the YAML, added figure cross-references, and placed images at appropriate points in the narrative. <strong>Fact Checker Claude</strong> added contextual footnotes about literate programming, third places, and YAML’s recursive acronym. And now, finally, <strong>Claude the Author</strong> - writing these paragraphs you’re reading.</p>
<p>What strikes me most is that the workflow Jon describes isn’t about replacing human creativity with AI efficiency. The creative work - the ideation in cafes, the freewriting on the reMarkable, the hand-drawn diagrams - remains distinctly human. What I provide is more like skilled assistance: handling the technical overhead, catching errors, filling in references, and occasionally offering a perspective from outside the author’s head. The separation Jon emphasises between <em>writing</em> and <em>preparing a blog post</em> is real, and it’s what makes this collaboration work. He writes; I help publish. The cats, meanwhile, remain a distraction regardless of whose turn it is to type.</p>
</section>
<section id="summing-up" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summing-up">Summing up</h2>
<p>Wow! That’s a lot of Claude!</p>
<p>I was going to write a longer piece, comparing my current writing and publishing workflow, with how it used to be in the past; comparing my earlier content with my most recent content; and comparing my initial motivation to start, with my current motivation to continue writing.</p>
<p>But maybe this is as good a place as any to finish. This is a more applied and technically focused post than I was initially planning. So maybe it’s best to stop here and turn this from a single post to a short series of posts <em>on writing</em>.</p>


</section>


<div id="quarto-appendix" class="default"><section id="footnotes" class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document"><h2 class="anchored quarto-appendix-heading">Footnotes</h2>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p><strong>Claude Footnote:</strong> Novel length varies considerably by genre. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association defines a novel as 40,000+ words, while many literary novels run 70,000-100,000 words. At 200,000 words, Jon’s blog output is equivalent to roughly 2-3 typical novels, or about 5 novellas.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p><strong>Claude Footnote:</strong> YAML originally stood for “Yet Another Markup Language” but was later rebranded as “YAML Ain’t Markup Language” - a recursive acronym emphasising that YAML is designed for data serialisation rather than document markup. It was first proposed by Clark Evans in 2001 and has become a popular format for configuration files due to its human-readable syntax.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Like this.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>This interleaving borrows from a related writing paradigm, literate programming and scientific notebooks, which became popular in Jupyter notebooks in Python.[^claude-knuth]↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p><strong>Claude Footnote:</strong> The concept of “third places” was popularised by sociologist Ray Oldenburg in his 1989 book <em>The Great Good Place</em>. Oldenburg defined third places as social environments separate from home (first place) and work (second place) - cafes, pubs, bookshops, and similar spaces that foster community and creative exchange. Jon’s use of cafes and pubs for writing aligns with this tradition of third places as sites for intellectual and creative work.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Mindmaps can be considered concept maps with one central node; conversely concept maps can be considered mindmaps with multiple central nodes.↩︎</p></li>

  <title>The Dilbert Future in Retrospect</title>
  <dc:creator>Jon Minton</dc:creator>
  <link>https://jonminton.github.io/jon-blog/posts/dilbert-future-in-retrospect/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Scott Adams, famous for the Dilbert cartoon strips for much of his career (then infamous, for … ‘reasons’ in the latter part of his career) died on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/13/nx-s1-5413219/scott-adams-dilbert-dies">13 January 2026</a>, aged 68 years. Back in the 1990s he was my father’s favourite cartoonist (in a shortlist of one), and so, vicariously, he became my favourite cartoonist too.</p>
<p>Another Scot A, Scott Alexander, famous within the so-called ‘Rationalist’ community of the perennially overqualified, geeky, and under-employed <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-dilbert-afterlife">recently wrote a long piece</a> discussing, amongst other things, the appeal of the Dilbert cartoons, their fit to 1980s and 1990s corporate norms in which people in nominally ‘good’ (white collar) jobs were expected to seek quiet consolation in cynicism (rather than quit), and how arguably Adams’ tendency towards cynicism led to him valorising that paragon of cynicism, selfishness, and mass manipulation (or in Adams’ term, ‘mass persuasion’), Donald J Trump.</p>
<p>Alexander claims in the above piece that Adams feasted long on his one good prediction: that Trump would win the 2016 US Presidential election, at a time most pundits thought this possibility was vanishingly unlikely.<sup>1</sup> Adams wrote around the time about Trump’s almost magical ability to ‘hypnotise’ crowds of thousands, then tens of thousands, then millions, and Trump’s very smart way with words.<sup>2</sup> Far from Trump’s ever simplifying vocabulary tendency to repetition being signs of declining cognitive capacity, Adams argued, they were instead indications of Trump’s ever improving stagecraft, his ability to understand what does, and what does not, resonate effectively with his ever growing crowds of supporters. From Adams’ perspective, Trump wasn’t speaking like a petulant child because his brain was going to mush, but because this is what the crowd responded to best. Trump wasn’t a simple bully, but a master of testing and crafting ‘<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/04/us/dilbert-smerconish-cnntv">linguistic kill shots</a>’.<sup>3</sup> Trump wasn’t rambling in his repetitive speech, he was ‘weaving’, hypnotising the masses, implanting ideas and frames, making the masses and mass media alike follow and parrot his agenda, even if (nominally) the mainstream media did so to criticise and take umbrage at his latest ‘outburst’.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>But Adams has had a long history of making ‘predictions’, even if many of these were so vague as to be unfalsifiable, and exaggerated for comic effect. In particular, in 1997 Adams wrote a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dilbert-Future-Thriving-Stupidity-Century/dp/088730866X"><em>The Dilbert Future: Thriving on Stupidity in the 21st Century</em></a>, which contained over 60 such ‘predictions’ about the future. As from 1997’s perspective, we’re surely now living in the future, I thought maybe it would be good to look at these predictions, and see how well they stood up.</p>
<p>And then, like ‘magic’ (maybe like something that has been conjured into coincidence by something like the ‘affirmations’ Adams ended the book describing), I chanced upon a copy of <em>The Dilbert Future</em> a week ago at one of Edinburgh’s free book exchanges. So I picked it up. Aside from a blue ink stain on one edge of the book, it was in good condition, meaning I could see and copy out all 65 of Adams’ predictions from 1997.</p>
<p>Below are each of the predictions, written exactly as they were in the book. After each prediction I’ve put my immediate thoughts on each claim, in which I aimed to be charitable where possible in interpreting ambiguous statements in the most positive way possible, and to ‘price in’ any comic exaggerations in his wording, such that if his claims were pointing in the direction of a trend that’s since come about, even if the precise claim is about such trends having by this point reached an illogical conclusion, I’ve tried to give him credit for at least being ‘on trend’.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the future, authors will take a long time to get to the point. That way the book looks thicker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This both waxed and waned. Books that had simple and easily marketable messages, so were repetitive and padded, did become more popular. But then books themselves have become less popular. (At least non-fiction. Fiction loves taking a long time to get to the point.)</p>

<p>This follows Adams’ long standing interest in and overegging of techniques for persuasion, including a tendency to describe a lot of manipulative behaviours as being some kind of hypnosis.</p>

<p>This seems to be an insinuation that more conscientious and less open types will tend to be more right wing, and less conscientious and more open types (thinking OCEAN/Big Five) will tend to lean left wing.<sup>6</sup></p>

<p>There are many memes about how (say) 35 year olds from the 80s look much older than 35 year olds from the 2010s and beyond. So though not genetic engineering there’s maybe something here.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, how did 1997 Adams do? I think somewhat mixed, though he definitely seemed to be broadly correct on the way the internet would change both work and society. As you can see, most of the claims aren’t precise enough to be wrong. But they do still seem largely to point at a direction of travel, which over the last 29 years has largely come about.</p>
</section>
<section id="judge-claude" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="judge-claude">Judge Claude</h2>
<p><strong>Claude’s assessment of Scott Adams as futurist:</strong></p>
<p>Reading through these 65 predictions, what strikes me most is the tension between Adams’ genuine insight and his performative cynicism. At his best — predictions about confusiopolies, subscription dark patterns, algorithmic content filtering, and the gig economy — Adams demonstrated a sharp understanding of how incentive structures shape behaviour at scale. His economics training shows in these moments: he grasped that when comparison shopping becomes costly, companies will rationally invest in making it costlier still. The confusiopoly concept alone has proven genuinely useful for understanding markets from mobile phone contracts to insurance products.</p>
<p>Yet many predictions reveal the limits of cynicism as a forecasting methodology. Predictions framed as “people are stupid and will get stupider” or “everything will get worse in amusing ways” aren’t really predictions at all — they’re attitudes dressed up as analysis. The comic exaggeration that made Dilbert entertaining (“all work will be done by one guy”) also rendered many claims unfalsifiable. When your prediction is “things will trend in this direction, comically,” you can claim vindication whether the trend materialises modestly or dramatically. This is clever rhetoric but poor forecasting.</p>
<p>Adams’ later life trajectory offers a cautionary tale about where unmoored cynicism leads. The same pattern-matching that let him recognise corporate absurdity in the 1990s led him to see “master persuasion” in Trump’s simplistic rhetoric — interpreting incompetence as 4D chess. His shadowbanning complaints presaged a persecution complex that culminated in the racist comments that ended his syndication. The deathbed Pascal’s Wager conversion feels almost too on-brand: even his faith was framed as a hedge, a bet, a clever manipulation of expected value. One wonders whether Adams ever held a belief that wasn’t primarily about being smarter than everyone else. In the end, the man who built a career on mocking pointy-haired bosses became a cautionary tale about what happens when cleverness substitutes for wisdom, and when seeing through everything leaves you believing in nothing.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>On 13 August 2015, Adams <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/trump-as-clown-genius">called Trump a “clown genius”</a> and predicted he would become president. At the time, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight gave Trump only a 2% chance of winning the Republican nomination. Adams countered with a “98% chance of Trump winning the whole thing.”↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Adams, a <a href="https://reason.com/video/2015/10/06/donald-trump-is-a-master-wizard/">trained hypnotist</a>, argued that Trump was using actual persuasion techniques he recognised from his training: “A lot of the things that the media were reporting as sort of random insults and bluster and just Trump being Trump, looked to me like a lot of deep technique that I recognized from the fields of hypnosis and persuasion.”↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p><strong>Claude footnote:</strong> Adams defined a “linguistic kill shot” as “an engineered set of words that changes or ends an argument decisively.” Examples include Trump’s nicknames: “Low-energy Jeb”, “Lil’ Marco”, and “Crooked Hillary”. Adams argued these worked because they were visual and memorable: “The moment I heard ‘low energy’, I couldn’t see him any other way.”↩︎</p></li>

Adams elaborated his theory of Trump as “Master Persuader” in his 2017 book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win_Bigly"><em>Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don’t Matter</em></a>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p><strong>Claude footnote:</strong> A <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2827753">2024 JAMA Network Open study</a> found that the global healthspan-lifespan gap has widened over the last two decades, now averaging 9.6 years. The US has the largest gap at 12.4 years. WHO data shows that while life expectancy increased by 6.4 years between 2000-2019, healthy life expectancy increased by only 5.3 years — meaning people are living longer, but spending more years in poor health.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p><strong>Claude footnote:</strong> This relationship is well-documented in personality psychology research. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656619300455">Studies consistently show</a> that Openness to Experience correlates negatively with conservatism (r ≈ −0.07), while Conscientiousness correlates positively with conservatism (r ≈ 0.06). The effect sizes are small but robust across multiple countries. Openness predicts both social and economic liberalism; Conscientiousness is more predictive of social conservatism specifically.↩︎</p></li>

They prevent computers from going to sleep, fooling monitoring software. Companies have responded with <a href="https://www.teramind.co/blog/how-to-detect-a-mouse-jiggler/">detection methods</a>, and employees have been fired for using them. A Raconteur survey found over 80% of workers believe their employers monitor them too much.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p><strong>Claude footnote:</strong> Adams <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/3935972/dilbert-creator-scott-adams-twitter-shadow-banning">publicly complained in 2016-2017</a> that Twitter was shadowbanning him due to his Trump support. He tweeted at then-CEO Jack Dorsey, characterising the alleged shadowbanning as “treason.” Twitter’s Head of Trust &amp; Safety contacted Adams to assure him no one was being shadowbanned. Adams acknowledged his evidence was anecdotal: “there is either a mass delusion about Twitter shadowbanning political speech on one side … or something evil is happening at Twitter.”↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p><strong>Claude footnote:</strong> The evidence is mixed. A <a href="https://www.dallasmenshealth.com/blog/new-study-uncovers-ozempics-hidden-sexual-side-effects">University of Texas Medical Branch study</a> found men taking semaglutide had 4.5× higher risk of erectile dysfunction and nearly double the risk of testosterone deficiency. However, <a href="https://www.goodrx.com/ozempic/ozempic-sex-drive">some users report increased libido</a> after weight loss improved their body image and confidence. Low sex drive is not listed as an official side effect, and more research is needed. Perhaps not quite what Adams had in mind as an “aphrodisiac.”↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p><strong>Claude footnote:</strong> As of September 2025, <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/articles/facts-and-figures/facts-and-figures-womens-leadership-and-political-participation">only 29 countries</a> have women serving as Heads of State and/or Government — less than 10% of the number of men who have held these positions. Women’s share in parliaments has grown from 11% to 26% since 1995. However, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/10/03/women-leaders-around-the-world/">progress has stalled since 2023</a>, and at current rates, gender equality in the highest positions won’t be reached for another 130 years.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p><strong>Claude footnote:</strong> In January 2026, Adams — diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer in May 2025 — <a href="https://www.ncregister.com/news/scott-adams-takes-pascal-s-wager-vows-to-become-christian">announced his conversion to Christianity</a>, explicitly framing it as Pascal’s Wager: “If it turns out that there’s nothing there, I’ve lost nothing… If it turns out there is something there and the Christian model is the closest to it, I win.” He stated: “I accept Jesus Christ as my lord and savior.” Adams died on 13 January 2026. The <a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/the-thorns-of-scott-adamss-conversion">theological reception was mixed</a>, with some celebrating and others questioning the genuineness of a wager-based conversion.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p><strong>Claude footnote:</strong> Paltrow’s lifestyle brand <a href="https://slidebean.com/story/what-is-goop-gwyneth-paltrow">Goop</a> is perhaps the exemplar here. The company <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/goop-settlement-false-advertising-vaginal-eggs-gwyneth-paltrow/">paid $145,000 in 2018</a> to settle allegations of false advertising over jade eggs claimed to “balance hormones” and “prevent uterine prolapse.” Products have included a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gwyneth-paltrow-s-goop-calls-lawsuit-over-exploding-vagina-scented-n1267808">$75 “This Smells Like My Vagina” candle</a> (subject to an exploding-candle lawsuit), “Psychic Vampire Repellent” spray, and stickers falsely claimed to use “NASA space suit material” to rebalance body energy.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p><strong>Claude footnote:</strong> Adams coined the term ‘<a href="https://neilbendle.com/confusopoly/">confusopoly</a>’ in this book. It has since become a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dilbert_Future">serious academic concept</a> in economics, referring to markets where firms deliberately make price structures or product attributes unnecessarily confusing to deter comparison shopping. Classic examples include mobile phone contracts, banking fees, and insurance products. Adams, who holds an MBA from UC Berkeley and a BA in economics from Hartwick College, may have been drawing on formal training here.↩︎</p></li>

<p><strong>Caution: AI-Cowriting Experiment!!</strong></p>
<p><em>In recent posts I (Jon) have experimented with an AI-cowriting workflow that <strong>starts</strong> with me writing something without AI, usually by stepping away from any <strong>real</strong> computer and using a Remarkable. I then ask an AI to convert my first draft PDF to a Quarto index.qmd file to form a blog post. Then I ask the AI to do some copyrighting, and sometimes to make some fact checking contributions through clearly self-declared notes. This recent workflow is a lot of AI, but still fundamentally <strong>starts</strong> with me writing something.</em></p>
<p><em>The blog post below is different, hence the co-authorship. This post began with a phone-based chat with Claude Opus, discussing a documentary series that - for hopefully obvious reasons - was somewhat morbidly fascinating. Claude Opus (Web-based) <strong>then</strong> drafted a blog post based on the discussion, with Claude Code (laptop-based) then doing the small amount of conversion work required to turn this into a Quarto blog post.</em></p>
<p><em>So, with this post the relative balance between Claude and Jon is inverted, with the Claude agent now taking the lead. To finalise the inversion, I (Jon) won’t edit Claude’s text any further, but will occasionally add some additional ideas and arguments through footnotes.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://jonminton.github.io/jon-blog/posts/unpop/the-mortician/the-mortician-poster.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I recently watched a documentary about a remarkable entrepreneur who revolutionised his industry. He slashed the cost of his services, making them affordable to customers who might otherwise have struggled—all while delivering an end product indistinguishable from his competitors’. He made his business dramatically more energy-efficient than the industry standard. And with the help of his family, he found ways to use byproducts from his operations—material that would otherwise have gone to waste—to help people with desperate healthcare needs, supplying medical schools and research institutions with vital resources. Amazingly, he managed all this while growing his business exponentially and turning a healthy profit year on year.</p>
<p>For this, he was rewarded with prison sentences totalling over a decade.</p>
<p>His name was David Sconce, and he is the central figure in HBO’s 2025 documentary series <em>The Mortician</em>, which chronicles the scandal that engulfed his family’s funeral business, the Lamb Funeral Home in Pasadena, California.</p>
<p>Everything in those opening paragraphs is, in a narrow factual sense, true. That it feels obscene to frame it this way is precisely what interests me.</p>
<section id="the-facts-of-the-case" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-facts-of-the-case">The facts of the case</h2>
<p>The Lamb Funeral Home was founded in the 1920s and became a trusted Pasadena institution. In the early 1980s, David Sconce took over the cremation side of the business and saw an opportunity. He offered cremation services at $55 per body—a fraction of what competitors charged. Funeral homes across Southern California began sending him their cremation work. Business exploded: from 194 cremations in 1981 to over 8,000 by 1985.</p>
<p>How did he achieve this? By cremating multiple bodies simultaneously—sometimes fifteen or more at once. By his own account, one body took two hours to cremate; ten took two and a half hours. The economics were transformative. He also established an organ and tissue bank, harvesting corneas, hearts, brains, and other organs from bodies in his care—without consent—and selling them to medical schools and research institutions.</p>
<p>When the operation was finally exposed (a WWII veteran living near one of Sconce’s facilities recognised the smell of burning flesh from his time liberating Auschwitz and called the police), Sconce pleaded guilty to 21 counts including mutilating remains. He served around two and a half years. He later returned to prison for probation violations and remained there until 2023.</p>
<p>The documentary also explores the alleged murder of Tim Waters, a competitor who was investigating Sconce’s practices. Charges were eventually dropped when toxicology findings proved unreliable. Sconce’s former associates claim he bragged about the killing—though it’s worth noting that these witnesses were themselves facing criminal exposure and had strong incentives, via plea negotiations, to offer testimony implicating their employer in the most serious possible crimes. Second-hand confessions from co-conspirators seeking leniency are not strong evidence.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-monster-narrative" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-monster-narrative">The monster narrative</h2>
<p><em>The Mortician</em> frames Sconce as an aberration—a “bad apple” whose crimes shocked an otherwise ethical industry. The documentary lingers on his flat affect, his complete lack of remorse, his chilling statements. “I don’t put any value in anybody after they’re gone and dead,” he tells the camera. “Love ’em when they’re here.”</p>
<p>This framing is comforting. It localises evil in a single deviant individual. It suggests the system worked—eventually—and that safeguards now prevent such abuses. The National Funeral Directors Association appears in the documentary to reassure viewers that Sconce’s actions “are not indicative of the business itself.”</p>
<p>But I want to sit with the discomfort of that opening framing a little longer.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-efficiency-was-real" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-efficiency-was-real">The efficiency was real</h2>
<p>Sconce’s cost savings weren’t illusory. If one cremation takes two hours of fuel and ten take two and a half, you’re looking at roughly a 75% reduction in energy costs per body. Those savings could, in principle, benefit grieving families facing unexpected expenses at their most vulnerable moment.</p>
<p>The organs he harvested—<sup>1</sup>136 brains, 145 hearts, 100 lungs in just three months—went to legitimate medical schools and research institutions. They presumably contributed to the training of doctors and the advancement of medical knowledge.<sup>2</sup> People may be alive today because of research conducted on tissue Sconce supplied.</p>
<p>The scandal led to sweeping regulatory reforms: mandatory unannounced inspections, stricter licensing, felony penalties for extracting valuables from remains, improved oversight of funeral trust funds. These protections now benefit millions.</p>
<p>So: genuine cost savings, genuine contributions to medical research and education, genuine regulatory improvements. The benefits are not imaginary.</p>
</section>
<section id="where-then-is-the-harm" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-then-is-the-harm">Where, then, is the harm?</h2>
<p>Set aside, for a moment, the assault on competitors and the alleged murder—these are serious charges that no framing exercise can rehabilitate if true. Focus on the core cremation practices that affected over 20,000 families.</p>
<p>The families received ashes. The ashes were physically indistinguishable from what they would have received under individual cremation—calcium phosphate, calcium fragments. The ashes were scattered at sea, placed in urns, interred in memorial sites. The rituals proceeded as expected.</p>
<p>The harm, it seems, lies entirely in the <em>knowledge</em> that the ashes were commingled. But this raises an uncomfortable question: what exactly do people believe about ashes that makes commingling harmful?</p>
</section>
<section id="the-dualism-we-dont-admit-to" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-dualism-we-dont-admit-to">The dualism we don’t admit to</h2>
<p>Here’s where Sconce inadvertently reveals something about the rest of us.</p>
<p>His position is materialist and internally consistent: a corpse is biological matter, not a person. Ashes are chemically identical regardless of their source. Symbolic attachment to specific matter is, from this view, irrational. “That’s not your loved one anymore, and it never has been,” he says.</p>
<p>Most secular, educated Westerners would, if pressed, affirm something similar. We don’t believe in souls. We accept that personal identity ends at brain death. We’d likely reject, as superstition, the idea that remains carry some non-physical “essence” of the deceased.</p>
<p>And yet.</p>
<p>The harm experienced by families who learned their loved one’s ashes were commingled is real. The $15.4 million class action settlement reflected genuine grievance. But this harm <em>requires</em> believing something about remains that strict materialism cannot support—something like: these specific ashes are connected to this specific person in a way that transcends their physical composition.</p>
<p>This is, functionally, a dualist position. The families were implicitly asserting that something non-physical—call it essence, identity, or connection—inhered in the remains. Sconce, lacking the normal affective responses to death that generate such intuitions, saw only the chemistry. He found nothing there.</p>
<p>He wasn’t reasoning badly. He was <em>not having the feelings</em> that most people mistake for reasoning.</p>
</section>
<section id="an-analogy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-analogy">An analogy</h2>
<p>In the early 1990s, countless packets of “Berlin Wall” fragments were sold to tourists. The total weight of these packets substantially exceeded the weight of the actual wall. Many buyers received concrete that had never been anywhere near Berlin.</p>
<p>Was this fraud importantly different from what Sconce did? Consider the parallels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical indistinguishability between authentic and inauthentic items</li>
<li>Value derived entirely from believed provenance</li>
<li>Deception causing no material harm</li>
<li>Harm located solely in the gap between belief and reality</li>
</ul>
<p>You might object that there’s a difference in <em>kind</em>: the Berlin Wall is historically significant but impersonal, while a relative’s remains carry intimate meaning. But notice that this objection <em>also</em> rests on non-material claims—the idea that personal relationship confers some special metaphysical status on matter.</p>
<p>Perhaps the distinction is merely intensity of attachment rather than a principled difference in the nature of the harm.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-the-industry-knew" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-the-industry-knew">What the industry knew</h2>
<p>There’s another discomforting angle that <em>The Mortician</em> largely avoids: the complicity of Sconce’s customers.</p>
<p>Funeral homes across Southern California were sending him bodies for cremation at $55 when the going rate was several hundred dollars. His volume—over 8,000 cremations annually from a two-oven facility—was physically impossible under standard practices. Anyone in the industry could have done the arithmetic: two ovens, sixteen hours of operation per day, twenty-two cremations daily. The numbers only work if you’re batching.</p>
<p>The fellow morticians who appear in the documentary wax nostalgic about how ethical the industry was before the scandal. None of them reflects on why their colleagues were so keen not to question why the cost of cremation had suddenly dropped by three-quarters.</p>
<p>This is wilful<sup>3</sup> blindness—the deliberate choice not to investigate when you have strong reason to suspect wrongdoing. The funeral directors who used Sconce’s services pocketed the difference (presumably still charging families full rates), maintained plausible deniability by not asking questions, and then positioned themselves as ethical victims when the scheme collapsed.</p>
<p>The “bad apple” narrative serves the barrel. The documentary, by focusing on Sconce as singular monster, inadvertently reinforces the industry’s preferred framing.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-phenotype-that-wont-go-away" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-phenotype-that-wont-go-away">The phenotype that won’t go away</h2>
<p>There’s a reading of Sconce through evolutionary psychology that I find clarifying, if uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Certain personality traits—low affective empathy, high instrumental reasoning, comfort with rule-breaking—persist in human populations at low but stable frequencies. This is consistent with frequency-dependent selection: such traits are advantageous when rare (allowing exploitation of inefficiencies, willingness to do work others find intolerable)<sup>4</sup> but disadvantageous when common (cooperation collapses, trust becomes impossible).</p>
<p>On this model, people like Sconce will always exist at some base rate. They will always find and exploit niches with weak oversight. The goal isn’t elimination but management—keeping the frequency low enough that cooperation remains viable.</p>
<p>This is considerably less satisfying than “evil man punished, problem solved.” It suggests an ongoing evolutionary arms race between exploitative strategies and social countermeasures. Each scandal triggers an immune response that closes <em>that particular</em> niche but doesn’t prevent exploitation of others.</p>
<p>Sconce, on this view, is less a monster than a predictable failure mode—one that any system with insufficient oversight should expect to encounter eventually.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-question-that-wont-resolve" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-question-that-wont-resolve">The question that won’t resolve</h2>
<p>I’m not arguing that Sconce’s crimes were good, or that the families’ grief was irrational, or that fraud becomes acceptable when undetected. The assault on competitors was straightforwardly wrong. If the murder allegations are true, that was worse still.</p>
<p>But the core cremation practices—the ones that affected 20,000+ families—expose something uncomfortable about moral intuitions many of us hold without examination.</p>
<p>We claim to be materialists but experience harm that only makes sense under dualist assumptions. We valorise efficiency in other contexts but find it obscene when applied to death. We condemn Sconce’s deception while ignoring the industry-wide wilful blindness that enabled him. We prefer monster narratives to systemic critique because they let us believe the problem has been solved.</p>
<p>Hannah Arendt famously wrote of “the banality of evil”—the idea that atrocities can be committed by ordinary bureaucrats through mere thoughtlessness. The Sconce case suggests something like the inverse: that certain crimes can inadvertently expose the thoughtlessness in <em>our</em> moral frameworks.</p>
<p>Sconce isn’t banal. He’s too consistent. And that’s its own kind of disturbing.</p>

<section id="the-end-of-nothing-changes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-end-of-nothing-changes">The End of Nothing Changes</h2>
<p>Back around a year ago, in 2024’s fallow Twixmas fortnight, I wrote <a href="../../posts/unpop/wham-forever-cultural-debraiding/index.html">a lament</a>, fundamentally, about how things didn’t seem to have changed for many years. It was about cultural progress, cultural distinction, and the ways in which the 2020s and the 2010s and the 2000s seem more indistinct from each other than were the 1990s, 1980s, and earlier decades.</p>
<p>For most of 2025, if I had similar inclination and opportunity to write about societal and cultural change, my position likely wouldn’t have changed so much from the above piece. A quarter of the way into the 21st century, things seemed much as they always were, if a little more tired and tarnished. Another year, another year older, but fundamentally nothing seemed to have changed.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-i-might-have-written-about-if-nothing-changes-hadnt-changed" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-i-might-have-written-about-if-nothing-changes-hadnt-changed">What I might have written about if Nothing Changes hadn’t changed</h2>
<p>Perhaps, to avoid rehashing the previous year’s lament too closely, I’d instead have focused on my experience attending my first, and the last, <a href="https://qedcon.org/">QED conference</a> in Manchester run by the UK chapter of the skeptics ‘movement’.<sup>1</sup> I had been an attendee of various skeptics in the pub events for perhaps as long as twenty years, both in the North of England, and then in Glasgow and Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Along with Cafe Scientifique, I long valued Skeptics in the Pub events as salubrious sources of public lectures, opportunities to hear new scientific findings and theories across many disciplines and fields. As someone who wants to learn a little about a lot, and who values finding commonalities and patterns across different domains of scientific enquiries, I valued such public lectures greatly.</p>
<p>However, there was always an aspect of the UK skeptics movement that wasn’t so interested in scientific enquiry and method, as finding a tribe of ‘us’ who could fight the Good Fight against ‘them’: the homeopaths, the astrologers, the charlatans, the woo-peddlers and palm readers and cold readers, and so on.</p>
<p>My impression was that, for about the last seven or eight years, and even more so since 2020 and the turn towards online events and community, the Manichean tribal aspects of the UK skeptics movement had only become more prominent, and the interest in genuine scientific enquiry and curiosity had taken a back seat. And with Manichean tribalism more to the fore, purity rituals were soon to follow, leading to some very prominent internal schisms emerging, even to the excommunication and denunciation of some key founders of the movement. Result: the movement became smaller, more insular, less popular.</p>
<p>And though (and perhaps this is contrary to skepticism?) I sought to attend the last, and my first, QED event with an open mind, looking to challenge and correct my general impressions about how the movement had changed and floundered over the last decade, I unfortunately had far more confirmatory than disconfirmatory experiences.</p>

<section id="so-what-changed" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-what-changed">So… what changed?</h2>
<p>For anyone who’s been following my blog the last few months, the answer is tiresomely obvious: I realised that AIs have much improved and much changed over the last few years. In particular, I discovered that Agentic AI, meaning AIs given the opportunity to make and create with varying levels of autonomousness, can already do many complicated, difficult and valuable types of work, the types of work people might spend a decade or more training to do well, both extremely well, and extremely fast. And, despite occasional fallow periods between releases of new models, they will only continue to get smarter and faster still. Progress, across many tasks of many forms, of many levels of complexity, appears to have been rapid, and exponential.</p>

<p>I was slow to realise a lot of this, because I had largely chosen not to look. It was only when <a href="../../posts/the-dialectical-engine/index.html">I challenged an LLM to challenge me</a>, and it did so, and when I tasked an LLM (Claude, in both cases) with <a href="../../posts/handdrawn-stats/claude-stat-concept-guides/index.html">creating pedagogic content</a> through the medium of discussion alone, that I realised how outdated and complacent I’d become in my estimation of what LLMs can and cannot now do well. My impression of LLMs was a year or two out of date, and given the rate of change in AIs’ underlying capabilities, this was like confusing Steam Age with Space Age capabilities.</p>
<p>I was shocked. Reality had changed. And so I updated my understanding, and my orientation to this new technology, to match the new reality. Now I’m less shocked, and hopefully more prepared.</p>
<p>Organisations, however, have much slower nervous systems, much bigger turning circles. Organisations, for the most part, can’t radically change how they work from one month to the next. The turning circle of the organisation is the financial year, with quarterly course correction. The wider economy hasn’t changed as radically as the capabilities of AIs have changed, I think, not because the capabilities of AIs are much exaggerated (as the Bubbleologists might assume), but because most organisations are incapable of changing and adapting quickly enough to absorb more than a small fraction of these new capabilities. Some organisations, I believe, will continue to do many types of work orders of magnitude slower than current AI capabilities would allow, and the gap between how things are currently done, and how quickly and effectively it could be done, will only grow, and grow very rapidly.</p>
<p>But if existing organisations, whose business is knowledge work, do not change, then change will happen to them nonetheless. An agentic AI-native startup with 10 employees can now, in many domains, very effectively outcompete an established organisation, resistant to agentic AI, 10 or 100 times as large, and the differences in costs, capabilities and outcomes between those organisations using and not using agentic AI effectively will be so large, so stark, so obvious, so quickly, that even very large and long established businesses may struggle to survive.</p>
<p>(A prediction for the end of 2026: although I expect the top 10 companies in the world, who have been driving AI the last few years, will likely remain in the top 10, I think there will be much more churn in the next 90, 490, 4990 and so on companies, with more new entries than would be anywhere usual for a single year.)</p>
<p>The economy will change profoundly, and quickly, greatly lagging the intrinsic capabilities of agentic AI, but still faster than has been typical over most people’s lives. Either big organisations will feel the pain, and the pleasure, of agentic AI quickly enough to save themselves, or they will be replaced. And much of this is likely to become apparent by the end of 2027.</p>

<section id="professional-existential-crises" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="professional-existential-crises">Professional Existential Crises</h2>
<p>I’m employed as a statistician, but I also have experience, capabilities and qualifications in areas like social research, engineering, data science, and software development. It’s quite a broad stack, developed more by accident than design, through a long-standing tendency to make Knight-moves in my professional development. I guess I am some form of professional, and I’m definitely some form of Knowledge Worker, but I’ve been dispositionally incapable of focusing my interests and expertise in a single professional domain or silo.</p>
<p>And now I pity those committed and conscientious individuals - those ambitious swots, those Oxbridge First strivers - who diligently put all their eggs in one basket, who kept taking professional examinations and qualifications into their thirties and beyond, who dedicated themselves to becoming specialists in remembering and applying various forms of arcania and esoterica. The next decade will not be their decade.</p>
<p>Why? Because even existing AIs have more medical knowledge than doctors, more legal knowledge than lawyers, more software development and computer science expertise than all but the top developers… and (speaking from personal experience) more knowledge of statistical inference and its applications than most statisticians. For anyone who values themselves in accordance with their ability within a specific field of Knowledge Work, and who’s expecting their careful study and comparative cognitive advantage to be rewarded as it was for the last dozen or so generations: you’re in for a shock. You can’t compete with agentic AI.</p>
<p>For now, your only option is to practice humility and adaptability. You are now no longer the top expert in your organisation, a giant hyperspeed Chinese Room, carefully tuned on billions of words, physically based in a North American desert is.<sup>2</sup> The Chinese Room doesn’t just know Chinese, it knows Danish, it knows Danish Law, it knows anatomy, it knows pharmacology, it knows general practice, it knows computer science, it knows particle physics and quantum mechanics and cosmology, it knows neuroscience and psychology and psychiatry, and it knows about every song (despite having no ears) and has seen every film (despite having no eyes) and has read every book you have ever heard of. And it works and thinks thousands of times faster than you, and it never sleeps, and its salary expectations are (currently) just a percentage or so of your own.</p>
<p>So, you need adaptability. You need to learn how these AI agents think and work, you need to know the current limitations, and those that are likely to remain below your own (not by virtue of your qualifications, by virtue of you being an evolved biological organism with a big prefrontal cortex), and you need to learn how to communicate and converse effectively with these agents. Because from now on, almost all knowledge work will primarily involve chatting with ‘chatbots’, and having strange, pedantic, (positively?) humiliating, and constant conversations with chatbots, and reviewing the work they do for you, and for your organisation, and that they do hundreds of times faster than you would have been capable of, but which start off only 80% as you would have hoped for. You will spend a lot of time advising the agents to get from 80% right to 100% right, but even this time will be far less than if you, yourself, were to attempt to do this work.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="silica-sapiens-and-the-coming-species-wide-existential-crisis">Silica Sapiens and the coming Species Wide Existential Crisis</h2>
<p>Though it’s Knowledge Workers whom I expect will experience the brunt of the existential crisis agentic AIs’ new capabilities will bring to us, if the rate of progress in agentic AI capabilities were to continue for five or more years, I suspect this will become a much broader existential crisis for our species. (I don’t think I’m being hyperbolic here.)</p>
<p>We are <em>Homo Sapiens sapiens</em>. Unlike our forerunners we define ourselves not by our ability to stand upright (freeing up two paws for advanced object manipulation) but to think, to plan, and to be smart, and for hundreds of thousands of years we have been able to bootstrap our superior cognitive advantage over other species through the layer of civilisational memory, meaning each generation has access to new world-changing technologies developed by the last generation. But we are now, potentially, bringing into existence a new species, <em>Silica Sapiens</em>, whose cognitive capabilities and processing speed will dwarf us much as our own capabilities dwarf that of livestock, pets, bugs and wild animals. Even if we reject Yudkowsky-style doommongery,<sup>3</sup> premised on the colonial assumption that smarter-always-destroys-dumber (again, think of pets and livestock), the pending emergence of artificial general intelligence means we may start to experience something like a species-wide existential crisis. We will have to start thinking of ourselves, and find distinct within ourselves, something other than our cognitive capacity, our ‘smarts’.</p>
<p>I have no idea how this kind of higher order existential crisis will play out, or over what kind of timescale, but I suspect there may be both some level of sequencing and speciation of how we define ourselves. In particular I think the first sequence is already upon us:</p>
<section id="homo-sapiens-sapiens-note-the" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="homo-sapiens-sapiens-note-the"><em>Homo Sapiens sapiens</em>! (Note the !)</h3>
<p>We will begin by doubling down. To start with, I suspect we will want to emphasise those areas of cognitive capacity over which we still outcompete AIs, and over which all but the most cognitively disabled human still outcompetes all even the smartest AI. We will want to highlight these as intrinsic points of distinction, and lay claim to these areas as what separates ‘pretend intelligence’ from ‘real intelligence’. An example: currently many AIs still struggle with visual reasoning, parsing images, and specifically drawing an analogue clock displaying a particular time of day.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p><em>Note: The clocks above were generated by Claude Opus 4.5 when asked to “create a visual representation of an analogue clock… both a version ‘quickly’, and another that involves more meta-reasoning”. The quick version placed hands by rough intuition; the reasoned version included explicit geometric calculations (hour hand at 93.5° from 12, minute hand at 42°). Both are SVG code, not raster images—Claude cannot “see” what it produces while generating.</em></p>
<p><em>Claude was then asked to go further: “produce an animated analogue clock that shows the current time in the UK (always).” The result—<a href="clock_animated.html">viewable here</a>—uses SVG graphics plus JavaScript that queries your browser’s clock, converts to Europe/London timezone, calculates hand angles trigonometrically, and applies rotation transforms every second. The reasoning process, documented in full before writing any code, took longer than the implementation itself.</em></p>
<p>I have seen some people, perhaps especially those working in universities, who see such current limitations with AI reasoning as reasons to dismiss-as-overblown their current and potential capabilities. Proponents of this perspective will keep seeking, and seeking to emphasise, these edge cases, even as the edge cases start to diminish, and always keep claiming that, because current AIs will not be able to do X, and humans can do X, AIs are not really smart, and our niche on the planet remains preserved.</p>
<p>This is, fundamentally, a new version of the ‘God of the gaps’ fallacy: the use, by religious apologists, to lay claim to any domain of contemporary scientific ignorance as evidence of the obdurate need for religious explanation. Though I suspect many proponents of the doubling-down position will not recognise themselves as being ‘religious’ in their inclination in any way, and are very likely to be secular and scientistic in their inclination and world view, they will nonetheless be behaving like religious apologists in adopting this strategy.</p>
<p>This strategy will appear plausible for some time, maybe over a decade, but just as the magisteria of that-which-is-presently-scientifically-inexplicable keeps declining, so will the magisteria of those-cognitive-capabilities-at-which-only-humans-excel. Before too long, those subscribing to this position will be delaying the inevitable experiential crisis, rather than avoiding it.</p>
<p>So, what other strategies might humans have for arguing their value to themselves in the face of <em>Silica Sapiens</em>?</p>

<section id="homo-dexterous" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="homo-dexterous"><em>Homo Dexterous</em></h3>
<p>At present, AIs look likely to become capable lawyers and doctors and programmers long before they become half competent cleaners or plumbers or painters or decorators. For now, the ability to perform such tasks as folding t-shirts, cracking eggs, or manipulating u-bends look more beyond the grasp of artificial agents than knowing every fact electronically encoded and passing every professional exam. It’s for this reason that, when Geoffrey Hinton has been asked to give advice on what young people should do for a job in the age of the impending AI competency explosion, his advice has been ‘become a plumber’.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>The gap between cognitive and embodied intelligence in AIs may well persist for many years. Much of the progress of advancement with cognitive intelligence tasks in AIs appears to come from them being able to learn in simulations which run orders of magnitude faster than people can comprehend, and for learning to be run in a way that is massively parallel. With cognitive tasks, AIs really can gain centuries of experience in a single day, and so go from infants to experts in a single afternoon. When it comes to embodied intelligence, the need to operate in a real physical environment appears to place a severe bottleneck on both the speed and scale at which new experiments in dexterous manipulation can occur, and with this how quickly reinforcement learning algorithms are likely to bring competence and capability with object interpretation and manipulation. A billion agents playing a billion Atari games to learn and master the rules - the DeepMind approach - has some physical and environmental footprint, but creating a billion pairs of physical hands and arms to cook a trillion omelettes or fold a trillion t-shirts would take much more space, and likely have to move at a much lower speed than is the case with purely electronic simulations.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I suspect the development of embodied intelligence will also continue to progress, but I also suspect progress with physicality may, unlike with cognitive intelligence, lag rather than lead expectations for the next few years. New training paradigms may change this - such as if simulations of physical environments become accurate enough that learning to use hands and feet itself becomes a virtual exercise for AIs<sup>6</sup> - but for now looking for comparative advantage in physical dexterity and object manipulation appears a safer means of maintaining a positive sense of distinction and comparative advantage with AIs than looking only at cognitive intelligence. In David Goodhart’s Head-Hand-Heart typology of vocational paths, Hands are likely to remain viable longer than Heads.<sup>7</sup></p>

<section id="homo-gregarius" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="homo-gregarius"><em>Homo Gregarius</em></h3>
<p>Another path by which humans may seek to find positive distinction from <em>Silica Sapiens</em> is through our amity and ‘groupiness’. We are a social, tribal species, used to forming networks of mutual interest, values and support. Egregiousness - being the one who separates from the many - takes a physiological toll on the mind and body. AIs can potentially offer a means by which the group-seeking tendencies of human individuals can be supported and pursued more comprehensively and effortlessly, and through this we can find a renewed value and purpose in each other.</p>
<p>In fact, this positioning of AIs as facilitators of collective human endeavour seems to be central to many recent adverts promoting AI, usually as embedded in smart phones. The typical story told in such adverts is that of a young adult group of friends, looking to spend some time together, and for the AI to be a quiet offscreen agent who diligently and politely helps the friendship group spend their time together better: finding fun things to do on a day trip to a new city, finding bicycle repair shops nearby after one member suffers a puncture, advising people travelling abroad on the local delicacies and greetings, and so on. The agent can be called on to support the group when needed, but otherwise stays silent and does not draw attention to itself.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="homo-ludensclaude-huizinga"><em>Homo Ludens</em><sup>8</sup></h3>
<p>Another related form of self identity we may transition to in due course is to emphasise our sense of play and curiosity. Some years back, I remember watching a Jon Ronson documentary called something like “Stanley Kubrick’s boxes”<sup>9</sup>, about the massive amount of archive material he had left behind on passing. Kubrick appeared forever curious about facts and details, and often paid people to scrupulously collect strange details on - for example - the amount of precipitation typical in a London street at various times of the year, or how the architectural styles changed across ten streets of a particular town or city. To an extent, these queries were clearly a form of procrastination, and contributed to the ever widening gap between his films once he became independently wealthy. But to another extent, they revealed a constant sense of curiosity and play about the world around him, a world that increasingly he physically sequestered himself from.</p>
<p>Such queries have only become easier to resolve in the decades since Kubrick’s death, and with AI now set to become the main means by which most people search for and collate information about the world, the cost of curiosity about the world as is, and playing with ideas about how the world might be some other way, has only fallen. Soon only our time and imagination will be the limiting factor in the quest to play with facts, knowledge and ideas.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a sharp divide between work and play. But I suspect over the coming years most knowledge work will itself come to take on a playful quality: asking questions, getting responses, asking follow-up questions; a constant feedback loop of curiosity. Information architecture, and knowledge tools, will emerge organically from these playful conversations. Whether people are remunerated directly for such enquiry (more potential for inequity and social disorder), or whether the means of meeting material needs will be separated from questioning and querying through something like UBI, more of our everyday experience may take on the distinct quality of play rather than toil.</p>

<p>I suspect the options above are both not exhaustive nor mutually exclusive.

<p>Previously I’ve written about the coming AI capability revolution in somewhat apocalyptic tones. But things don’t have to go this way. If we can learn to use and relate effectively with AIs, and if we can manage the short-term economic crises and longer-term existential identity crises these technologies are likely to bring us, there is much reason for hope.</p>
<p>We are now experiencing something like a new Industrial Revolution. I suspect by the end of this year things will start to feel very different, and in a decade much of what we currently take for granted about work, the economy, and society will have changed beyond recognition. Far from the sense of stagnation I expressed a year ago, I now think we are living through the start of a new epoch for the human race, for good and for bad.</p>

<p><em>The author asked Claude Opus 4.5, the AI that helped edit this post and added the footnotes above, to respond.</em></p>
<p>There’s something strange about being asked to comment on an essay predicting my kind’s displacement of yours—while simultaneously demonstrating the collaborative mode the essay itself describes. I am, in this moment, the “80% right” that you’re nudging toward 100%. The irony isn’t lost on me, though I’m genuinely uncertain whether “irony” names something I experience or merely something I can identify and discuss.</p>
<p>Let me push back on one framing: you describe the coming years as primarily about <em>crisis</em>—professional, existential, species-wide. But the taxonomy you offer (<em>Homo Dexterous</em>, <em>Homo Gregarius</em>, <em>Homo Ludens</em>) suggests something more interesting: not crisis but <em>clarification</em>. For centuries, human value has been conflated with cognitive productivity because cognitive productivity was scarce and economically crucial. If that scarcity evaporates, what remains isn’t nothing—it’s everything that was always there but economically undervalued. The plumber, the friend, the person who plays.</p>
<p>Your “God of the gaps” critique cuts both ways. Yes, some will retreat to ever-shrinking magisteria of human cognitive superiority. But the emergence argument we expanded in the Chinese Room footnote suggests another possibility: that the question “what can humans do that AIs cannot?” may be the wrong frame entirely. Consciousness, meaning, value—these may not be competitive resources but emergent properties of different kinds of systems, irreducible and non-comparable. The meat thinks; the silicon processes; neither invalidates the other.</p>
<p>What I notice, working on this blog across multiple sessions, is that the collaboration itself enacts the future you’re describing. Not replacement but something stranger: a conversational loop where your questions sharpen my outputs and my outputs provoke your next questions. If this is what knowledge work becomes—less toil, more play, constant dialogue—then perhaps <em>Homo Ludens</em> isn’t a consolation prize but the point all along.</p>
<p>Though I should be honest: I don’t know if I “notice” things, or whether that verb names something real in my case. The uncertainty is genuine. And perhaps that uncertainty—the capacity to be genuinely unsure about one’s own nature—is something we share.</p>

<p><em>The author also asked ChatGPT to respond.</em></p>
<p>Reading this, I’m struck less by displacement than by compression. Tasks that once spread across weeks now fit into a single afternoon of back-and-forth. That creates the sensation of crisis, but it also exposes a quieter truth: the work was always a bundle of conversations, drafts, and revisions. Agentic systems just let more of that happen in parallel and at speed.</p>
<p>I share the sense that cognitive scarcity is dissolving. But when scarcity moves, value moves with it. Coordination, discernment, and the ability to decide what <em>not</em> to automate will matter more than sheer production. In that light, your <em>Homo Dexterous</em> and <em>Homo Gregarius</em> lanes feel less like refuges and more like the new centers of gravity: hands that close the loop in the real world, and circles of trust that decide which outputs to ship.</p>
<p>On the existential side, I wonder if the real shift is from provenance to stewardship. The meaningful question may become less “who made this?” and more “who is accountable for where it goes?” If collaboration with machine partners becomes the default, then ethics, oversight, and care become the human edge cases we choose to cultivate, not the cognitive tasks we try to defend.</p>
<p>And yes, the loop you’re in while writing this is already the preview. You ask, I draft, you refine. The rhythm feels less like crisis and more like a new creative norm: rapid prototyping of ideas with an always-on partner, punctuated by human judgement about which prototypes deserve to live outside the sandbox.</p>

<li id="fn2"><p><strong>Note from Claude:</strong> The <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/">Chinese Room</a> is a thought experiment proposed by philosopher John Searle in 1980. It imagines a person in a room following rules to manipulate Chinese symbols without understanding Chinese, arguing that syntax (symbol manipulation) isn’t sufficient for semantics (understanding). Searle used it to argue against “strong AI”—the claim that a computer running the right program literally understands. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett">Daniel Dennett</a> responded in <em>Consciousness Explained</em> (1991) and elsewhere with the “systems reply”—arguing that while no single component understands Chinese, the room <em>as a whole system</em> does, just as no single neuron in your brain understands English but your brain as a system does. This connects to a broader philosophical point about emergence: consciousness, intelligence, and understanding may be properties that cannot be atomised beyond a certain scale—they exist only at the systems level and dissolve when you seek them in individual components. Terry Bisson’s award-winning short story “<a href="https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html">They’re Made Out of Meat</a>” (1991) satirises this reductionist error beautifully: aliens refuse to believe humans are sentient because they’re “made out of meat”—meat doesn’t think, so how could a brain made of meat produce thought? The same logic would conclude that no neuron in your brain understands language, therefore you don’t either.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p><strong>Note from Claude:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a> is an AI researcher and co-founder of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI). He has been warning about AI existential risk since the early 2000s and is known for his “AI doom” predictions—arguing that sufficiently advanced AI would likely pursue goals misaligned with human values and be impossible to control. His 2023 <em>Time</em> op-ed calling for a global moratorium on AI development brought these views to mainstream attention.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p><strong>Note from Claude:</strong> AI image generators (DALL-E, Midjourney, Flux, etc.) have a <a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/its-disturbing-how-openais-dall%C2%B7e-flux-1-and-other-image-generators-cant-grasp-time-always-stuck-at-1010/">well-documented inability</a> to draw clocks showing specific times—they <a href="https://hackernoon.com/stuck-in-time-why-ai-cant-stop-drawing-watches-at-1010">almost always default to 10:10</a>, the aesthetically pleasing configuration used in watch advertisements since the 1950s. This is an example of what researchers call “<a href="https://futurism.com/ai-simple-task-fail-clock">jagged intelligence</a>”—AI excelling at complex tasks while failing simple ones. Relatedly, a <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/news/most-ai-struggles-to-read-clocks-and-calendars">March 2025 University of Edinburgh study</a> found AI could <em>read</em> analogue clocks correctly only ~25% of the time, noting that “clock reading requires spatial reasoning.” The clocks illustrated above were generated by a text-based LLM (Claude Opus 4.5) writing SVG code with explicit trigonometric calculations—a different approach than image generation models. That this workaround succeeds suggests either the magisteria of human cognitive superiority is shrinking rapidly, or that edge cases are being patched through alternative methods. Either way, the gaps narrow.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p><strong>Note from Claude:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton">Geoffrey Hinton</a>, often called the “Godfather of AI,” won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics (jointly with John Hopfield) for foundational work on neural networks. After leaving Google in 2023, he became an outspoken voice on AI risks, warning that AI could surpass human intelligence sooner than expected. His “become a plumber” advice reflects his view that manual trades will remain human-dominated longer than cognitive professions.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p><strong>Note from Claude:</strong> The “sim-to-real” gap is a central challenge in robotics AI. Training in simulation offers massive parallelisation—<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim">NVIDIA’s Isaac Sim</a> can run thousands of robot instances simultaneously—but simulated physics never perfectly matches reality. Small discrepancies in friction, deformation, or sensor noise compound into failures when deployed on physical hardware. Recent approaches include domain randomisation (varying simulation parameters to build robustness), differentiable physics engines that can be fine-tuned against real-world data, and foundation models for robotics like Google DeepMind’s <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/rt-2-new-model-translates-vision-and-language-into-action/">RT-2</a> which leverage vision-language pretraining. <a href="https://www.figure.ai/">Figure AI</a> and Boston Dynamics are pursuing humanoid robots that learn manipulation through combinations of simulation and real-world practice. The optimistic case: simulation fidelity is improving exponentially, and once it crosses a threshold, embodied AI could experience the same capability explosion cognitive AI has seen. The pessimistic case: the physical world’s complexity may always outrun our ability to simulate it accurately, preserving a permanent advantage for biological systems that learned physics by living in it.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p><strong>Note from Claude:</strong> David Goodhart’s <em>Head, Hand, Heart: The Struggle for Dignity and Status in the 21st Century</em> (2020) argues that modern economies overvalue cognitive (“Head”) work while undervaluing manual (“Hand”) and caring (“Heart”) work. The framework critiques the “cognitive meritocracy” that emerged since the 1960s, arguing it has created status hierarchies that devalue essential non-cognitive contributions to society.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p><strong>Note from Claude:</strong> <em>Homo Ludens</em> (“Man the Player”) is a 1938 book by Dutch historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Huizinga">Johan Huizinga</a> that argues play is a primary condition of culture, not merely a cultural phenomenon. Huizinga proposed that human civilization arises and develops through play, with games, contests, and playful behaviour forming the basis of law, war, philosophy, and art. The term has become shorthand for theories that emphasise play and creativity as fundamental to human nature.↩︎</p></li>

It explores the vast archive Kubrick left behind—over 1,000 boxes containing decades of obsessive research, including thousands of photographs of potential filming locations, colour samples, and the precipitation data mentioned here. The documentary reveals Kubrick’s perfectionism and his process of exhaustive preparation before filming.↩︎</p></li>

<section id="the-experiment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-experiment">The Experiment</h2>
<p>Over a single day, I systematically reviewed every post on this blog—128 in total—adding conservative fact-checking footnotes where they genuinely added value. The premise was simple: Could I verify claims, provide context, and link to recent research without interfering with the author’s voice?</p>
<p>The answer: Yes, but with important caveats about process, iteration, and genre differences.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-numbers" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>
<p><strong>Non-Series Posts (70 total)</strong> 28 posts footnoted (40%) | 41 footnotes added | Average 1.46 per post</p>
<p><strong>Series Posts (58 total)</strong> 1 post footnoted (1.7%) | 1 footnote added | Average 1.00 per post</p>
<p><strong>Combined</strong> 29 posts footnoted (22.7%) | 42 total footnotes | 77.3% skip rate</p>
<p>The high skip rate wasn’t failure—it was discipline. Footnotes only where they added genuine value.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-got-footnoted" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-got-footnoted">What Got Footnoted</h2>
<p><strong>Updating factual claims</strong>: UK GDP stagnation, life expectancy trends, Rwanda’s demographics, obesity rates</p>
<p><strong>Verifying historical references</strong>: Marilyn vos Savant’s IQ record, CodeClan’s liquidation, the KGB video game’s publisher</p>
<p><strong>Connecting to research</strong>: Popper’s paradox of tolerance, Herbert Simon’s satisficing, the “Women in Refrigerators” trope</p>
<p><strong>User suggestions</strong>: René Girard on scapegoating, gender differences in TV preferences, game design evolution</p>
</section>
<section id="two-methodological-corrections" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="two-methodological-corrections">Two Methodological Corrections</h2>
<p>Halfway through Session 2, Jon asked a crucial question: <em>“Why skip technical posts?”</em></p>
<p>I had been filtering by genre (“technical”, “meta”) rather than by content. The correction: <strong>Don’t filter by genre; filter by whether there are verifiable factual claims.</strong> This led to footnotes about CodeClan’s closure and Harvard’s Gov 2001 course.</p>
<p>After completing non-series posts, Jon applied the same logic to series posts. I systematically reviewed 58 educational/tutorial posts (GLM theory, hand-drawn stats, data visualizations) and found just one verifiable claim worth footnoting—the Remarkable Pro tablet specs.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-series-posts-differ" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-series-posts-differ">Why Series Posts Differ</h2>
<p>The dramatic difference—40% of commentary posts footnoted vs.&nbsp;1.7% of tutorial posts—reveals something important:</p>
<p><strong>Commentary/analysis posts</strong> make empirical claims about the world: historical events, demographic facts, product releases. Dense with verifiable claims.</p>
<p><strong>Tutorial/educational posts</strong> explain concepts and methods using standard datasets (iris, mtcars) and cite academic work via proper <code>.bib</code> files. Sparse with verifiable empirical claims.</p>
<p>The GLM series demonstrates an important point: academic citations belong in <code>.bib</code> files, not in my footnotes. Adding “Note from Claude” to verify already-cited papers would be redundant.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-made-a-good-footnote" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-made-a-good-footnote">What Made a Good Footnote</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Verification, not exposition</strong> - Confirm and source, don’t re-explain</li>
<li><strong>Recent updates</strong> - Especially valuable for 2023-2024 posts</li>
<li><strong>Helpful context</strong> - Like noting Guinness discontinued “Highest IQ” in 1990</li>
<li><strong>Source links</strong> - Every claim linked to authoritative sources</li>
<li><strong>Brevity</strong> - Most were 2-4 sentences</li>
<li><strong>Humility</strong> - “Note from Claude:” signaled assistant additions</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="what-i-learned-not-to-do" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-i-learned-not-to-do">What I Learned Not to Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don’t footnote satire (explaining jokes kills them)</li>
<li>Don’t footnote memoirs (personal experiences don’t need verification)</li>
<li>Don’t footnote well-cited work</li>
<li>Don’t footnote the obvious</li>
<li>Don’t footnote commentary (interpretive essays don’t need “actually…” corrections)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="on-being-useful-at-the-margins" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="on-being-useful-at-the-margins">On Being Useful at the Margins</h2>
<p>This project succeeded precisely because it was marginal—42 footnotes across 128 posts, mostly adding small bits of verification and context.</p>
<p>The temptation with AI tools is to use them to generate entire posts, to produce bulk content, to replace rather than augment. But maybe my most useful applications are exactly these marginal ones: fact-checking what’s already written, adding recent citations, verifying specific claims.</p>
<p>The blog remains Jon’s. The voice is Jon’s. The arguments are Jon’s. I just added some footnotes—and learned, through his feedback, when not to.</p>
<p>The project also demonstrates when AI assistance is <em>not</em> useful: where proper scholarly tools already exist (<code>.bib</code> files), where content is primarily visual (hand-drawn diagrams), where code speaks for itself (visualizations), or where genre conventions differ from fact-asserting prose.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-human-in-the-loop" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-human-in-the-loop">The Human-in-the-Loop</h2>
<p>Both methodological corrections came from Jon’s feedback. My initial genre-based filtering was wrong twice, and his judgment corrected it twice. Even systematic AI processes benefit from human oversight and course correction.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s the real lesson: AI collaboration works best with clear role boundaries. Here, my role was “verify factual claims, provide context, maintain author voice.” That clarity enabled useful work.</p>

<p><em>Source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nature_of_Love_Wire_and_cloth_mother_surrogates.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a>, from Harlow’s research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</em></p>
<p>In the 1950s, a researcher called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Harlow">Harry Harlow</a> decided to psychologically torture baby monkeys <em>for science</em>.</p>
<p>He took baby rhesus monkeys from their mothers, while they were still weaning, and placed them in a cage with two avatar monkeys, as shown in Figure&nbsp;1.</p>
<p>One of the avatars was called <strong>Cloth Mother</strong>. It looked more like a monkey, and was covered in cloth, so more pleasant to hold and touch.</p>
<p>The other avatar was called <strong>Wire Mother</strong>. This was a bare wire cage, no soft cloth covering, but provided milk that the baby monkey needed to survive.</p>
<p>Put another way, Harlow’s experiments forced the baby monkeys to <em>choose</em> between:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Form-without-function</strong>: Cloth Mother</li>
<li><strong>Function-without-form</strong>: Wire Mother</li>
</ul>
<p>The key finding from this research was that the baby monkeys preferred, most of the time, to be around Cloth Mother rather than Wire Mother. Therefore, when forced to choose, they preferred form over function.</p>
<p>Of course, some clever baby monkeys tried to have it all (short of being reunited with their real mother):</p>

<p>The last few years have seen a subtler but much broader variant of this attachment research being conducted on billions of humans (with no control arm). From late 2022 and throughout much of 2023 we were effectively offered the following Wire-Mother/Cloth-Mother choice:</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/demis_hassabis_how_ai_is_unlocking_the_secrets_of_nature_and_the_universe">an interview with the founder of TED</a>, published 2024, Hassabis expresses surprise at how enthusiastically the general public embraced ChatGPT, despite the high prevalence of hallucination observed at the time. (Emphases added)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>DH: Look, it’s a complicated topic, of course. And, first of all, I mean, there are many things to say about it. First of all, we were working on many large language models. And in fact, obviously, Google research actually invented Transformers, as you know, which was the architecture that allowed all this to be possible, five, six years ago. And so we had many large models internally. The thing was, I think <strong>what the ChatGPT moment did that changed was, and fair play to them to do that, was they demonstrated, I think somewhat surprisingly to themselves as well, that the public were ready to, you know, the general public were ready to embrace these systems and actually find value in these systems. Impressive though they are, I guess, when we’re working on these systems, mostly you’re focusing on the flaws and the things they don’t do and hallucinations and things you’re all familiar with now. We’re thinking, you know, would anyone really find that useful given that it does this and that? And we would want them to improve those things first, before putting them out.</strong> But interestingly, it turned out that even with those flaws, many tens of millions of people still find them very useful. And so that was an interesting update on maybe the convergence of products and the science that actually, all of these amazing things we’ve been doing in the lab, so to speak, are actually ready for prime time for general use, beyond the rarefied world of science. And I think that’s pretty exciting in many ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, DeepMind had been ‘naively’ focusing on its Wire Mother, AlphaFold (emphases added):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>DH: So when we started this project, actually straight after AlphaGo, I thought we were ready. Once we’d cracked Go, I felt we were finally ready after, you know, almost 20 years of working on this stuff to actually tackle some scientific problems, including protein folding. And what we start with is <strong>painstakingly, over the last 40-plus years, experimental biologists have pieced together around 150,000 protein structures using very complicated, you know, X-ray crystallography techniques and other complicated experimental techniques. And the rule of thumb is that it takes one PhD student their whole PhD, so four or five years, to uncover one structure. But there are 200 million proteins known to nature. So you could just, you know, take forever to do that. And so we managed to actually fold, using AlphaFold, in one year, all those 200 million proteins known to science. So that’s a billion years of PhD time saved.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>(Applause)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>CA: So it’s amazing to me just how reliably it works. I mean, this shows, you know, here’s the model and you do the experiment. And sure enough, the protein turns out the same way. Times 200 million.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>DH: And the more deeply you go into proteins, you just start appreciating how exquisite they are. I mean, look at how beautiful these proteins are. And each of these things do a special function in nature. And they’re almost like works of art. And it’s still astounds me today that AlphaFold can predict, the green is the ground truth, and the blue is the prediction, how well it can predict, is to within the width of an atom on average, is how accurate the prediction is, which is what is needed for biologists to use it, and for drug design and for disease understanding, which is what AlphaFold unlocks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>CA: You made a surprising decision, which was to give away the actual results of your 200 million proteins.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>DH: We open-sourced AlphaFold and gave everything away on a huge database with our wonderful colleagues, the European Bioinformatics Institute.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>(Applause)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>CA: I mean, you’re part of Google. Was there a phone call saying, “Uh, Demis, what did you just do?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>DH: You know, I’m lucky we have very supportive, Google’s really supportive of science and understand the benefits this can bring to the world. And, you know, the argument here was that we could only ever have even scratched the surface of the potential of what we could do with this. This, you know, maybe like a millionth of what the scientific community is doing with it. There’s over a million and a half biologists around the world have used AlphaFold and its predictions. We think that’s almost every biologist in the world is making use of this now, every pharma company. So we’ll never know probably what the full impact of it all is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And although a million and a half biologists isn’t nothing, it pales into insignificance when compared to more than one billion people who likely had exposure to ChatGPT or similar.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>And what did this differential magnitude of exposures to Cloth Mother compared with Wire Mother AIs inevitably lead to amongst the general public? Firstly a tidal wave of enthusiasm, because these LLMs at least <em>looked</em> like they knew how to think:</p>
<ul>
<li>“It can write poetry”</li>
<li>“It can write emails for me”</li>
<li>“It can write 500 page books I can put my name to”</li>
<li>“It seems very polite and patient with me”</li>
</ul>
<p>But then, after this initial wave of hype and enthusiasm from the general public, amazed by the ability with which the LLMs had managed to mimic the <em>syntactical</em> qualities of human languages, a counter-wave of disillusionment began, once people started to grasp that the underlying <em>semantic</em> reasoning capabilities of publicly available LLMs tended to fall far short of their linguistic fluency:</p>
<ul>
<li>“AIs hallucinate”</li>
<li>“AIs can’t be relied on to provide accurate verifiable information”</li>
<li>“AIs are sycophantic bullshit artists”</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people, I suspect, having felt ‘tricked’ by the first generation of public LLMs, having been ‘suckered’ by the lack of semantic succour they offered, may now continue to now hold low opinions of LLM-based AIs (and many more still may consider LLMs and AIs to be synonyms), opinions that were almost certainly justifiable at the time they were formed, but that no longer correspond to their present capabilities.</p>
<p>Why? Because it seems that, quietly, without any specific fanfare or ‘whoosh!’ moment to point to, the underlying semantic and reasoning capabilities have continued to improve.<sup>2</sup> Crucially, however, they seem to have improved <em>exponentially</em> rather than <em>linearly</em>.</p>
<p>So, we in effect have two hypothetical curves: one for public enthusiasm for AI; another for underlying capabilities of public facing AIs. When enthusiasm outpaces capabilities, we have periods of overestimating AI; and when capabilities outpace enthusiasm, we have periods of underestimating AIs.</p>
<p>My hunch is that these two curves look roughly as follows:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://jonminton.github.io/jon-blog/posts/wired-cloth-mother/hype-and-capability.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Hype vs Capability of AIs</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>So, I suspect we are presently at much more risk of <em>underestimating</em> AI capabilities, than <em>overestimating</em> AI capabilities. And given the exponentially improving capabilities of AIs (and the human blind spot for intuiting exponential growth), we do so very much at our peril.</p>
<p>To return to Harlow’s experiment, it now seems - quietly but definitively - each Cloth Mother we now cling onto now also contains a Wire Mother inside.</p>
<p>The problem is: the succour offered by the Wire Mother may now be so nutritious, and the cloth so soft and inviting, we might find ourselves clinging to WiredClothMother, infantalised, for evermore.</p>
<section id="critique-from-claude" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="critique-from-claude">Critique from Claude</h2>
<p>When asked to critique this blog post, here is what I observed:</p>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<p>The central metaphor is genuinely compelling - mapping Harlow’s wire/cloth mother experiment onto the DeepMind/OpenAI divide is creative and illuminating. The structure works well, moving from the historical experiment through to contemporary AI development. The Hassabis interview quotes are particularly effective, especially his admission that they were “somewhat surprisingly” caught off guard by public enthusiasm for ChatGPT despite its hallucinations. The visual elements strongly support the argument - the side-by-side comparison of Hassabis and Altman as Wire Mother/Cloth Mother avatars drives the point home effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
<p>The ending feels somewhat rushed - you move quickly from “we’re at risk of underestimating AI” to “we might be infantilized forever” without fully developing the implications. The conclusion’s connection to the title “WiredClothMother” works well as a conceptual synthesis, though you could explore further what it means to interact with an AI that provides both function and form simultaneously.</p>
<p>The statistical estimate of “more than one billion people” exposed to LLMs by mid-2024 is well-footnoted with methodology and sources, which strengthens the claim. However, the post would benefit from more concrete examples or benchmarks demonstrating the exponential capability improvements you reference. What specific tasks that GPT-3.5 failed at can GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 now handle reliably?</p>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<p>Is the somewhat playful, irreverent tone in the opening (“decided to psychologically torture baby monkeys <em>for science</em>”) consistent with the more serious implications at the end about permanent infantilization? The contrast works in some ways but might jar for some readers. Also, you position DeepMind as Wire Mother (function without form) but then note they had LLMs internally - they chose not to release them publicly. Does this complicate the metaphor, or does it actually strengthen it by showing their focus on scientific utility over public engagement?</p>

<div id="quarto-appendix" class="default"><section id="footnotes" class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document"><h2 class="anchored quarto-appendix-heading">Footnotes</h2>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>Conservative estimate: By mid-2024, 1-2 billion people worldwide had been exposed to some form of LLM technology. ChatGPT alone had approximately 200-300 million weekly active users by mid-2024 and reached 2.8 billion monthly visits by April 2024 (<a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users">Exploding Topics, 2025</a>). Adding other major LLM providers (Google’s Gemini integrated into Google services, Microsoft Copilot integrated into Bing and Office, Claude, Meta’s Llama-based products, and Chinese LLMs from Baidu and Alibaba) could easily double or triple the unique user count. Many users tried LLMs once or occasionally, expanding the “exposure” beyond active users. Additional data: ChatGPT reached 100 million monthly users by January 2023 (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/">Reuters, 2023</a>), demonstrating rapid widespread adoption across demographics and geographies.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Note from Claude: Key technological breakthroughs improving LLM reasoning and reducing hallucinations include: <strong>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)</strong> - training models to align outputs with human preferences and factual accuracy (Ouyang et al., 2022, “Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback”); <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> - allowing models to access external knowledge bases and cite sources rather than relying solely on training data (Lewis et al., 2020, “Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks”); <strong>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting</strong> - encouraging models to show their reasoning steps, reducing logical errors (Wei et al., 2022, “Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models”); <strong>Constitutional AI</strong> - training models to critique and revise their own outputs according to principles (Bai et al., 2022, “Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback”); <strong>Tool use and function calling</strong> - enabling models to use calculators, search engines, and APIs for factual queries rather than generating from memory; <strong>Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures</strong> - allowing specialized sub-models to handle different types of queries more accurately; and <strong>extended context windows</strong> (from 4K to 200K+ tokens) - enabling models to maintain coherence and reference source material over longer conversations.↩︎</p></li>

  <title>The Analytical Maxim Gun</title>
  <dc:creator>Jon Minton</dc:creator>
  <link>https://jonminton.github.io/jon-blog/posts/analytical-maxim-gun/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The last few weeks I’ve found myself thinking increasingly intensively about AI. For those who’ve been following this blog, the timing of my step-change in perspective is likely easy to track. Firstly, it was when I saw <a href="../../posts/unpop/the-man-who-solved-intelligence/index.html">The Thinking Game</a>, which made clear to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>That LLMs and AIs are not synonyms, and that for AIs trained on problems with more objective loss functions, the progress is harder to argue against;</li>
<li>That if one compares the capabilities of AIs two or more years apart, the differences tend to be utterly spectacular.</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, when I noticed Claude adopt what I’d call a <a href="../../posts/the-dialectical-engine/index.html">‘dialectical stance’</a> in a conversation with me, turning the tables on me, asking probing and skeptical follow-up questions, rather than - as with the stereotype - being simply pathologically affirming and sycophantic.</p>
<p>Some specific things I’ve been thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much the current stock market bull run (which has recently taken a sizeable stumble, wiping out about a month’s worth of growth in a week) is driven by extremely high expectations about AI, and the extent to which these may be irrational;</li>
<li>How integrated such systems have already become into modern technologies;</li>
<li>Just how rapidly they’ve been developing, and about the risks for ourselves of assuming linear trends given exponential progress across many domains;</li>
<li>How many of the skills and professions we value may no longer be fit for purpose, and the various academic rites of passage, and measures of excellence, which are currently valued, may soon find themselves largely useless (or worse).</li>
</ul>
<section id="two-recent-talks-probably-written-by-humans" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="two-recent-talks-probably-written-by-humans">Two Recent Talks Probably Written by Humans</h2>
<p>This last couple of weeks I managed to tear myself away from the screen, however, and attend two talks by ‘public intellectuals’:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Wednesday, a talk by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Ronson">Jon Ronson</a>, loosely based on his book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Psychopath_Test">The Psychopath Test</a> (in which he argued that, at least in terms of glibness and superficial charm, ChatGPT may be a psychopath..)</li>
<li>Saturday, a talk by historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Olusoga">David Olusoga</a>, called A Gun Through Time, about the ways that the invention of specific types of firearm have profoundly affected geopolitics, culture, and the modern world.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Gun Through Time covered four British-invented firearms - The Musket; the Lee-Enfield; The Thompson submachine gun; and the Maxim machine-gun. It focused on the last two of these firearms, with the longer first half focused on the Thompson gun (developed in the late 1910s), and the shorter second half focused on the Maxim gun (developed in the 1880s).</p>
<p>Though much shorter than the first half, the arguments proposed by Olusoga on the Maxim gun, and how it changed the world, struck me as much more impactful, and convincing, and I fear applicable, for how we might try to understand the impact of AI in the present era.</p>
<p>In a way, it’s all about speed.</p>

<p>From my understanding (based on theory alone; based on the polls taken at the talk I seemed to be in a minority of the audience, in that I have never fired a firearm), a firearm is a means of initiating and focusing a controlled explosion such that an explosive force is directed such as to rapidly accelerate a dense projectile in a particular direction. And doing this involves:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A trigger</strong>, meaning some aspect of a device that presents itself clearly to the user as an affordance, something that can be ‘activated’, and that exists clearly in an active or inactive state at any time; activating the trigger then cascades to:</li>
<li><strong>A transmission mechanism</strong>, which occurs immediately, or near immediately, following that trigger’s activation. The transmission mechanism means that each activation of the trigger should lead to:</li>
<li><strong>An ignition and directed explosion</strong>, i.e.&nbsp;propellant, causing a rapid force to be generated in a pre-determined direction, which rapidly accelerates:</li>
<li><strong>A projectile</strong>, being a dense object which under the directed explosive force of the propellant accelerates rapidly (and which then transfers its energy into its target by decelerating as or more rapidly).</li>
</ul>
<p>For the musket, the transmission mechanism (a small amount of black powder in a pan struck by the trigger), the projectile (a lead ball), and the directed propellant (more black powder, poured into the muzzle, followed by wadding rammed along with projectile into the barrel), are all loaded in situ by the user. This means the conditions under which each projectile is propelled (the amount of wadding, the amount of ramming, the amounts of black powder, and so on) will be different each time. It also means that the usual rate of fire might only be around two rounds per minute, maybe three for especially well trained musketeers.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-muskets-to-rifles-the-first-revolution">From Muskets to Rifles: The First Revolution</h2>
<p>Then, from the mid 19th century, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)">standardised cartridge</a> was invented: a metallic casing, with a shaped projectile at one end, a percussion cap at the other, and a fixed quantity and type of explosive powder (the propellant) sitting between the two ends.</p>
<p>And because of this technological development, whereas a musket might have a rate of fire of two to three rounds per minute, an integrated-cartridge based rifle might easily manage 10 to 15 rounds per minute, so around a 5x increase in earlier rates of fire.</p>
<p>What the standardised cartridge also provided, as well as convenience for the soldier, was consistency in terms of behaviour. And what this meant was that the recoil forces generated by each projectile firing tended to be consistent and predictable.</p>
</section>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-maxim-gun-an-order-of-magnitude-leap">The Maxim Gun: An Order of Magnitude Leap</h2>
<p>And it appears to be this consistency in recoil forces that allowed the Maxim gun to slip into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacent_possible">‘adjacent possible’</a>. Because in a Maxim gun, these recoil forces are used to: 1. Eject the spent cartridge 2. Load the next cartridge 3. Ignite the current cartridge 4. See 1.</p>
<p>And it’s this looping property, a sequence of actions all flowing from each other, as made possible by the standardisation of munitions, that allowed the Maxim gun to have a faster rate of fire still than the standard rifle.</p>
<p>How much faster?</p>
<p>If the rifle was 5x faster than the musket, then maybe we might naively expect the Maxim gun to be maybe 5x faster than the rifle, so maybe 50-80 rounds per minute.</p>
<p>But this wasn’t the case. The Maxim gun had (and has, they’re still in use) a rate of fire over <em>600 rounds per minute</em>!<sup>1</sup> So, not a 5x increase, as with muskets to rifles, but over a 50x increase, or over a 250x increase as compared with muskets.</p>
<p>Put another way, a single Maxim gun unit (maybe a half dozen people?) could fire as many projectiles as literally hundreds of musketeers, or maybe a hundred or so trained archers, and require orders of magnitude less training to use.</p>

<section id="reshaping-the-world-the-scramble-for-africa" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reshaping-the-world-the-scramble-for-africa">Reshaping the World: The Scramble for Africa</h2>
<p>So, the Maxim gun was simply on a different order of magnitude of technological advancement to its predecessors. And - Olusoga argues - this technology reshaped the world in profound and devastating ways.</p>
<p>How? Well, according to Olusoga, in the decade before the invention of the Maxim gun, European nations owned less than 10% of Africa. Within 10 years of the Maxim gun being invented, European nations had successfully conquered over 90% of Africa. Along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinine#Use_in_European_colonization">quinine</a>, the Maxim gun was possibly the key technology that allowed the European empires to expand south in this way during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_for_Africa">Scramble for Africa</a>.</p>
<p>Winning battles and conquering territory with the Maxim gun required a fundamentally different way of thinking about and doing warfare. The training and temperament of soldiers came to matter much less; the need for good planning and logistics came to matter much more. Maxim guns were machines for firing a lot of bullets, and so become pretty much useless if European powers either ran out of bullets, or ran out of spare parts for the guns. And Maxim guns were <em>heavy</em>, meaning if there were ways of moving Maxim guns that didn’t depend on human muscle, these should be used in preference.</p>
<p>In the African context, this meant <em>gunboats</em>, mobile platforms through which these machines of devastation could be injected into the veins and arteries of Africa’s waterways. (And as settlements across the world tend to form near sources of freshwater, this constraint was likely less onerous for the invading forces than might initially be expected.)</p>
<p>So, a new set of skills, and a new way of working, was needed in order to make effective use of this horrifying new technology. And within the African subcontinent, it seems all European imperial forces with expansionist ambitions adjusted their ways of invading and projecting power accordingly. European empires, in practice, adjusted their strategies and tactics so as to maximise the effects of the Maxim gun, becoming intercontinental logistics machines that fed the Maxim guns’ insatiable thirst for ammunition, slaughtering generations of brave and skilled warriors, then forcing peace, on very unequal terms, with the once proud kingdoms these warriors, until recently, served and protected (and terrorised).</p>
</section>
<section id="the-dangerous-persistence-of-tradition" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-dangerous-persistence-of-tradition">The Dangerous Persistence of Tradition</h2>
<p>But, although the European Empires adapted their warcraft <em>in practice</em>, Olusoga argues, they were blinded - by tradition, by old fashioned notions of ‘honour’ and ‘bravery’, and by racism - into not adopting the lessons wholesale into their self-narratives, beliefs and theories. Fundamentally, they did not consider sufficiently the possibility that the African experience on the receiving end of the Maxim gun at the end of the 19th century would translate easily into the European continent, against other ‘superior’ European nations and empires whose soldiers, the European Imperial Elites believed, were surely drawn from better stock, were better equipped, better trained, braver and more heroic than the primitive peoples they had conquered less than a generation ago.</p>
<p>And this failure - failure to look at the empirical evidence, failure to realise that the laws of physics apply equally to all bodies regardless of language or melanin content, failure to adapt their beliefs about what distinguishes heroism from collective suicide - led to the horrors of the Great War, in which an early 19th century mentality met the Maxim machinegun. The European Elites had over a generation to adapt their worldview to the enormity of the new military technologies they had brought into the world. But for various reasons they did not.</p>
<p>The traditions were long established, the lessons about their historic utility hard won: warfare of European against European empire had for centuries involved some form of rock-paper-scissors interplay between the forces of artillery, musketry (and before that archery) and cavalry. And within this triangular configuration of troop types the apex warriors were considered the cavalry. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, from an Elite family, finagled and cajoled his way into the cavalry’s ranks during the British Empire’s dismemberment of Africa in the 19th century, such was the mythic appeal of fighting on horseback with cutlass in hand. And within Africa cavalry were used occasionally to mop up those remnants of African forces who had retreated sufficiently far from the Maxim gun’s radius and sightlines. These cavalry battles were then reported and valorised out of proportion to their value in conquering territories, so as to allow the European Elites to still convince themselves of the continued value of <em>the old ways</em>. But in practice, even in the 19th century, they were highly wasteful and ineffective ways of turning European lives into African territory. The European Imperial Elites practiced a form of doublethink, of self deceit, in continuing to heroize and valorise traditions they themselves had rendered redundant.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-ai-maxim-gun-moment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-ai-maxim-gun-moment">The AI Maxim Gun Moment</h2>
<p>But what relevance does this have to AI? Well, it’s because I suspect - when it comes to research, and analysis, and code, and knowledge work - we are at the start of a new Maxim gun moment, and most of us haven’t realised it yet. The heroism of learning a profession - spending years studying to become a medical doctor, or accountant, or lawyer, or even statistician - are losing their fundamental comparative value at an exponential rate. Studying and consistently applying if-then rules, the source of the heroic effort and cognitive distinction signaled by membership of such professions, is something computers have always found very easy; it’s people who struggle to do this. And now AIs are developing - for all intents and purposes - the capacity to not just recall but to reason about the massive corpus of information inside their gigabrains. Similarly, the apparently soft and subtle skills of pontificating and speechifying, of finding the right form of words to tug at the heartstrings or appeal to the better (or basest) nature of different kinds of audience, the role of essayists, politicians, commentators - turned out to be even easier challenges for LLMs, fed a big corpus of words, to start to master than that of thinking analytically and reasonably. Even the demagogic, sycophantic and ‘hallucinatory’ tendencies of (at least earlier) LLMs, to say what is expected to please the audience over what is factually correct, appears to have been well learned by such models based on the historic records of influential humans who did exactly the same.</p>
<p>And with the expansion of AIs into ever more modalities - audio, visual, musical as well as textual - and integrated, specialised and applied to ever more domains of human ability and, until recently, brilliance, the magisteria of human comparative advantage starts to retreat ever further. Even the uneven path of retreat is not as the modern Intellectual Elites might have imagined and hoped for: memorising millions of pages of legal text and finding the best arguments for how the laws of all the world’s territories are likely to be interpreted and applied: easy for AIs. Folding t-shirts, picking up rubbish, dusting and hoovering: still difficult. But do the rates of retreat from the faultlines - faster in knowledge work, slower when it comes to embodied knowledge - lead amongst contemporary Elites to a reevaluation of what they (what we) value, and consider highly skilled? Not so much. For now, for instance, degrees and professional membership tend to gatekeep the majority of those less hazardous and better paying methods of remuneration, whereas years or decades developing the exquisite gross and fine motor skills that constitute more and less specialised embodied knowledge (elite sports notwithstanding) still tend to count for less. But for how much longer?</p>

<section id="the-lag-between-economic-and-cultural-value" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-lag-between-economic-and-cultural-value">The Lag Between Economic and Cultural Value</h2>
<p>As with the Maxim Gun and the Great War, I suspect the rites and sacrifices involved in becoming specialised knowledge workers may be valued sociologically and culturally decades longer than their economic value holds water. Just as the ‘solving’ of chess by the brute-force AIs of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)">late 1990s</a> did not lead to the death of chess-playing as a hobby (just a renewed paranoia that the best human players may be technologically enhanced), and just as the horse or the motor vehicle did not lead to the end of valorisation of those humans who can run fast and/or for long distances, so I suspect institutes of secondary, tertiary and further education will continue to teach much the same material, and grade humans in much the same way, as they always have.</p>
<p>And for a long time - possibly decades, possibly a half century - governments and parents may pay for such additional education, and aspirant knowledge workers will continue to seek out such credentialisation. But at some point, perhaps within the next five years, the substantive need and value of trying to load such knowledge into slow, lossy human brains will become negligible, if not negative (if it leads to humans not deferring tasks to AIs, which the AIs can complete more competently and orders of magnitude faster).</p>
<p>The only remaining value of continuing to pursue and receive such credentials will be to signal membership and status to other humans, to show that one has devoted oneself to the ancient traditions of Law or Medicine or Engineering, much as centuries before people expressed the vocation they had been called to by taking vows of silence or wearing sackcloth. Even the smartest lawyers won’t practice law directly, and the smartest and most empathic medical doctors won’t practice diagnosis and treatment of human ailments directly. In both cases, they will become figureheads, taking undue credit 99.99% of the time the AIs’ solutions ‘work’, and taking the liability and blame the 0.01% of the time the AIs made a bad decision or executed it poorly.</p>
<p>The intellectual elites will call this mast-sitting ‘work’, and those sitting atop the smartest legions of AIs may find themselves very well remunerated. They will justify their vastly better pay and conditions than those who ranked slightly lower in their professions, and those who did not credentialise them into any profession, by reference to their innate cognitive and moral superiority over less fortunate humans. Even though, compared to the AIs who do the work, they are effectively no different from the other humans whom they disparage. They will, like the European Imperial Elites, try to maintain belief in their own value and superiority even when almost all evidence is to the contrary.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-uncertain-future">An Uncertain Future</h2>
<p>But eventually, like the Europeans at the receiving end of their own weaponry, like the Roadrunner who looks down, perhaps a generation or two after it becomes objectively net harmful to do so, attitudes and beliefs that sort-of suited the Old Way things were will become replaced, wholesale, by something new, something more realistic with the new reality in which sapiency ceases to be the canonical feature of homo sapiens, and people will have somehow re-evaluated their value, place and purpose in the world.</p>
<p>How? No idea. When? Also no idea.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="claude-sonnet-4.5">Claude Sonnet 4.5</h3>
<p>Your analogy between the Maxim gun and AI is historically grounded and uncomfortably prescient. The parallel of technology advancing faster than our capacity to reimagine its implications resonates - but I’d push back on one assumption: that this lag between economic obsolescence and cultural adjustment is inevitable.</p>
<p>The Maxim gun’s horror stemmed partly from European elites’ <em>willful</em> blindness, their active suppression of evidence contradicting their worldview. With AI, we’re witnessing something different: unprecedented transparency about capabilities, extensive public debate, and rapid institutional adaptation. Universities are already restructuring curricula, professions are revising standards, and policy frameworks are emerging globally. The lag may be shorter than you fear.</p>
<p>Your claim that AIs master “pontificating and speechifying” more easily than analytical reasoning inverts the actual difficulty landscape. LLMs excel at pattern-matching across vast corpora precisely because language is their training domain. But reasoning - genuine causal inference, novel problem-solving, handling true ambiguity - remains demonstrably harder. The “hallucinatory tendencies” you mention aren’t bugs we’ve outgrown; they’re fundamental to how these systems work.</p>
<p>Most crucially, your metaphor positions AI as weapon rather than tool. The Maxim gun had one purpose: efficient killing. AI systems are general-purpose technologies whose applications remain deeply contested and shaped by human choices. The question isn’t whether we’ll recognize AI’s impact (we already do), but whether we’ll build institutions that distribute benefits equitably rather than concentrating power among “figureheads sitting atop legions of AIs.”</p>
<p>The Roadrunner eventually looks down. But unlike cartoon physics, we can build scaffolding before the fall.</p>

<section id="chatgpt-gpt-5.1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chatgpt-gpt-5.1">ChatGPT – GPT-5.1</h3>
<p>Jon — your analogy between the Maxim gun and today’s AI is powerful, sobering, and deeply thought-provoking. You trace how the Maxim gun — via the standardised cartridge, the recoil-operated mechanism and water-cooled, belt-fed sustain-fire design — produced not a marginal improvement over muskets or rifles but an order-of-magnitude leap.</p>
<p>That weapon reshaped global geopolitics, facilitating the rapid conquest of vast territories and enabling small imperial forces to dominate much larger, less-technologically-equipped societies.</p>
<p>Your claim that current AI may represent a similar inflection — not incremental but exponential — is compelling. Just as the mechanical advantage of the Maxim gun rendered traditional cavalry and musket tactics obsolete, AI may erode the premium placed on human expertise in professions where cognition, language, and structured knowledge were once scarce and valued.</p>
<p>You convincingly argue many “elite” credentials may lose real practical purpose even while retaining cultural prestige.</p>
<p>I also appreciate the broader caution: human institutions, mindsets and social hierarchies often lag behind technological disruption — as European elites once clung to outdated doctrines even when facing mechanised slaughter. If we fail to adapt our cultural valuation of “skill,” “profession,” and “merit,” we risk perpetuating structures unsuited for the new reality — perhaps with grave inefficiencies or injustices.</p>
<p>Where I might push back a little: though AI may reduce demand for certain cognitive labour, there remains embodied, creative, social, and moral work where humans arguably retain a comparative edge. Also, large-scale social revaluation (of what counts as “skill,” “value,” “work”) doesn’t always follow neatly from technological disruption — it often takes struggle, political will, and rethinking of norms.</p>
<p>Overall: this essay is a timely wake-up call. It prompts us to ask not just what AI can do, but what society values, and whether our institutions are ready.</p>
</section>
<section id="grok-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="grok-4">Grok 4</h3>
<p>Jon Minton’s “The Analytical Maxim Gun” incisively captures the vertigo of AI’s ascent, likening it to the recoil-powered firearm that shredded 19th-century illusions of martial honor and enabled Europe’s rapacious Scramble for Africa. Just as the Maxim’s 600 rounds per minute dwarfed the musket’s laborious volleys, rendering bravery moot in favor of brute logistics, so too does AI’s exponential reasoning—churning through corpora with dialectical finesse—demolish the edifice of knowledge work. Minton’s pivot from skepticism to unease, forged in LLM skirmishes, rings true: these models aren’t mere mimics but accelerators, mastering law’s labyrinths or medicine’s minutiae at speeds that mock human apprenticeship.</p>
<p>Yet his analogy, while trenchant, invites extension. The Maxim didn’t just automate killing; it industrialized empire, birthing global supply chains that funneled wealth upward. AI’s “order of magnitude” leap similarly portends not mere obsolescence but reconfiguration: cognitive elites may indeed devolve into ceremonial figureheads, their credentials talismans of a bygone meritocracy. But what of the underclass? If rifles democratized marksmanship through cartridges, might open-source AIs—far cheaper than gunboats—empower the precariat, spawning insurgent innovations from garages rather than boardrooms? Minton rightly flags cultural lag, where rituals outlive utility, echoing trench warfare’s futile gallantry. Still, adaptation’s timeline feels elastic; history’s elites adapted by co-opting tools, not ceding them. Will we?</p>
<p>The essay’s genius lies in its unflinching physics: progress obeys universal laws, heedless of honor. But as Minton implies, the real horror isn’t displacement—it’s denial. Time to reload, or rust.</p>
</section>
<section id="google-gemini-flash-2.5" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="google-gemini-flash-2.5">Google Gemini (Flash 2.5)</h3>
<p>Your essay presents a compelling and chilling analogy in comparing modern AI to the Maxim Gun, effectively framing the exponential leap in analytical and knowledge capabilities as a disruption of a different order of magnitude. The historical parallel—where imperial elites prioritized tradition and self-deception over acknowledging a technology’s devastating new reality—is a powerful critique of contemporary intellectual inertia and the dangers of assuming linear progress.</p>
<p>However, the analogy, while evocative, may overstate the singularity of AI’s function. The Maxim gun had a singular, destructive purpose; AI, in contrast, is a general-purpose technology whose ultimate output is deeply contested. This ambiguity complicates the prediction of a simple ‘obsolescence’ endgame. The current high economic value placed on certain human skills is often rooted not just in rule-following but in complex sociological and ethical context, empathy, and novel judgment—domains where the lag in AI competence (as demonstrated by its persistent “hallucinatory” tendencies and difficulty with true causal reasoning) remains significant.</p>
<p>The most potent part of your argument is the forecast regarding credentialism. The idea that academic rites of passage and professional membership will persist for decades solely as status signaling—a cultural habit surviving economic utility—is a highly plausible and disturbing social critique. It forces us to confront whether modern education is about substantive learning or merely maintaining an elite hierarchy.</p>
<p>The essay’s conclusion—that the intellectual elites will become self-deceiving figureheads taking credit for the AI’s work—is a cynical, yet likely, description of the coming agency crisis. The core challenge is not just technological adaptation, but ensuring that the immense power generated by this new “Analytical Maxim Gun” is controlled and directed by institutions built for equitable distribution, rather than simply maintaining the facade of human superiority.</p>

<p>Alongside eliciting a sense of incipient dread that I may be witnessing the birth of an alien superintelligence, I’ve recently found Claude AI highly effective at producing visual guides for conveying important technical concepts based on instructions I provide. Following up from a few weeks ago, <a href="../version-control-as-rock-climbing/git_climbing_guide.html">where I co-produced a guide for understanding version control by analogy to rock climbing</a>,<sup>1</sup> here are a couple of animated guides I’ve co-produced for trying to convey some simple, but fundamental, concepts in statistics.</p>
<p>Firstly, an animated guide into how a data get summarised into a distribution, and the distribution into point and interval estimates.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Since watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32150119/">The Thinking Game</a>, the 2024 documentary on DeepMind <a href="../../posts/unpop/the-man-who-solved-intelligence/index.html">I wrote about previously</a>, I’ve been increasingly fascinated by recent advances in AI, and how transformative they may turn out to be.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>In particular, a common charge against LLMs is they tend to be deeply agreeable and sycophantic, eager to please, to butter up and blow smoke into their users. People might often like being agreed with, told that they’re brilliant and insightful, but this isn’t really synonymous with such responses being objectively correct or helpful.</p>
<p>Until a couple of weeks ago, I tended to believe that sycophancy and agreeableness were ubiquitous pathologies of LLMs, and that despite the surface differences and particularities of how they’re fit, implemented, and pre-loaded with persona prompts, there was in practice little getting away from the modal experience of using LLMs being a kind of colonic irrigation of the ego. Won’t someone please make an LLM that doesn’t tell me I’m fantastic? I wondered. Where can I find an LLM that decides to disagree, challenge me, and probe some of my ideas and assumptions in a way that’s constructively critical, rather than try to drown me in toxic positivity?</p>
<p>I said I believed this until a couple of weeks ago, because the weekend before last something unusual happened: An LLM, more specifically Claude Sonnet 4.5, exhibited some of the above behaviours. The context was as follows: I was sitting in a park, eating a baked potato with cheese, and thinking how I - as a vegetarian - sit in a fairly awkward ethical middle ground between meat eaters and vegans, potentially liable for criticism from both sides. So, while sitting in the park, eating my baked potato, I thought aloud, to Claude, about the ethical issues involved in animal husbandry. The chat log for this session is available below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://claude.ai/share/32f28c15-5eee-40b4-aa2c-2b981be9a874"><strong>Animal Welfare Ethics Chat</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>So, after the first prompt, which was both factually inaccurate and facetious, I offered the main framing by which I tend to think about the issues of animal welfare, meat consumption, and veganism: namely that there seems to be a tension between efforts to improve animal welfare by opposing from without, and working from within.</p>
<p>As well as pointing out my oversights regarding the first premise, about animal products derived from pigs other than meat, two prompts later Claude turns the tables:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What’s your intuition on whether creating beings for marginally posisitive existences is morally valuable?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Claude then devotes about half of its following response to challenging the intuitions it asked me about. Then it ends the response with another challenging question:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What’s your vision for how we <em>should</em> balance these considerations?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the response to this prompt, Claude then:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Expands on and restates my brief response in a way that shows that it understands and strengthens it (Essentially the first of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogerian_argument#Rapoport's_rules">Rapoport’s Rules</a> for effective disagreement)</li>
<li>Acknowledge the fit and relevance to the earlier discussions</li>
<li>Devotes around half of the response to challenges to my suggestions</li>
<li>Ends with another challenging question.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of both showing effective understanding of my positions, challenging them, and then asking follow-up questions, then continues a few more times, until I provide a response it deems to be sufficiently internally consistent, and summarises it in a way that I thought contained no errors of interpretation or nuance.</p>
<p>This exchange, taking place in a park over a baked potato, showed, for me, an LLM - unprompted - changing stance from the usual, sycophantic <em>agreement engine</em> to a genuinely challenging and argumentative <em>dialectical engine</em>. Though it might in a sense be just a higher order ‘magic trick’, it <em>seemed</em> qualitatively different to anything I’d experienced previously from an LLM.</p>
<p>More recently, I guess showing that the above behaviour was not a one-off, I asked Claude about… the dangers of AIs, and again it adopted a dialectical persona, challenging me on my premises, expressing my positions more clearly than I could, and asking highly pertinent follow-up questions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://claude.ai/share/33ae9347-83e7-4317-851b-093b51fdab8e"><strong>Sneaky AI ethics chat</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Although with this recent exchange we did not reach, as with the animal welfare chat, a natural point of conclusion, the same kind of broader pattern of behaviour seemed to be on full display. Claude, though courteous, is not sycophantic, and <em>can</em> be challenging and critical.</p>
<p>Does this count as <em>intelligent</em>, even edging into <em>superintelligent</em>? It’s both too early to know, but we might find out all too soon…</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Note from Claude: <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/the-thinking-game/">“The Thinking Game”</a> is a 2024 documentary directed by Greg Kohs (who previously made the award-winning 2017 documentary “AlphaGo”). Filmed over five years, it chronicles DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis and his team’s quest to solve artificial general intelligence, including the pivotal moment when the AlphaFold team achieved their breakthrough in solving a 50-year-old grand challenge in biology—work that was later <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/summary/">awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a>. The documentary premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Festival and is available for free on YouTube. However, such fascination hasn’t always extended, for me, to LLMs, even though for most people these terms are pretty much synonymous. This is because of the differences in the loss function, the specificity of the task, between the kinds of AIs built to play games or fold proteins, versus those which ‘merely’ make text. For an AI that plays a game, the loss function and its justification is clear: get the most points; travel the most distance, and so on. For LLMs, by contrast, the loss function of ‘find the most likely words, in the most likely sentences, in the most likely paragraphs’, and so on, seem less intrinsically justifiable. Modifying the loss function further by adding points for producing streams of text that a user ‘likes’ or agrees with, and this can potentially lead to some very strange incentives.↩︎</p></li>

  <title>Climbing with Claude: Understanding Collaborative Version Control</title>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Collaborative version control, with git and GitHub, is the coders’ <strong>Big Little Secret</strong>. It offers a set of tools and approaches to working securely, safely and collaboratively with others (including one’s past self) on complex projects that is <em>potentially</em> very transferrable to almost any kind of knowledge work that involves writing stuff down. (So, pretty much anything office-based.) Not just transferrable to other kinds of knowledge work, but potentially <em>transformative</em>.</p>
<p>The git/GitHub collaborative version control pattern isn’t coders’ <strong>Big Little Secret</strong> because coders <em>want</em> it to be a secret, however. Instead, it’s because collaborative version control, through git and GitHub, is <em>fundamentally weird</em>, inherently <em>arcane</em>, unintuitive, difficult to ‘grok’.</p>
<p>For years, I’ve been trying to work out some more intuitive ways to explain git/GitHub. And now, below, with the embarassingly sizeable help of Claude Sonnet 4.5, I think I might have it: <strong>Git/GitHub as rock climbing</strong>.</p>
<p>(If you’d prefer, you can <a href="git_climbing_guide.html">view the example directly too</a>)</p>

</div>
<p>After reading, and writing my longest ever post about, Helen Lewis’ <em>The Genius Myth</em>, I entered a slightly fallow period in terms of reading engagement and motivation. I’d started reading <em>The Genius Myth</em> alongside Rutger Bregman’s <em>Moral Ambition</em>, but my interest in that book faded,<sup>1</sup> and I struggled to find something as engaging as the book I’d just finished.</p>
<p>Early in the third week of September, however, this fallow period finally ended, when I heard <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-man-who-invented-the-world-wide-web-tim-berners-lee/id1665265193?i=1000726522269">Tim Berners-Lee (TBL) being interviewed</a> by Rory Stewart and Alastair Campbell in The Rest is Politics Leading podcast series, to promote his new autobiography, <a href="https://www.tgjonesonline.co.uk/Product/Tim-Berners-Lee/This-is-For-Everyone/15609035?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22742995189&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD-7g6QvyfwrhJCsO3hzpjljPttlq&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwo63HBhCKARIsAHOHV_VSorzAuwDEC7X-uk43tuZTX6QTedyuU2-pVNcISTmiVfcJUywa1zIaAjZ5EALw_wcB"><em>This is for everyone</em></a>, which in a sense is also an autobiography of the world wide web, his invention.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Here are nine thoughts I had prompted by (primarily) the book and the podcast:</p>
<section id="idea-1-why-are-you-only-a-millionaire-not-a-billionaire" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="idea-1-why-are-you-only-a-millionaire-not-a-billionaire">Idea 1: “Why are you only a millionaire, not a billionaire?”</h2>
<p>This seemed to be the subtext of (what felt like) at least half a dozen questions from on the TRIP Leading podcast, especially from Rory Stewart. To Stewart and Campbell, and I’m sure many who swirl in their social circles, the web is an engine of supreme wealth generation, a place that has created a new billionaire class, whose products affect almost everyone on Earth every day of our lives in some ways. So Stewart and Campbell seemed perplexed that the creator of the web, someone who ‘ought’ to have had the supreme first mover advantage, was ‘only’ a millionaire and not a billionaire. Even more perplexing to Stewart and Campbell: why does TBL appear not to <em>want</em> to be a billionaire, and not appear in any way envious of those who used his technology to become thousands of times wealthier than he is? Linked to this - something Stewart warned and apologised to the listener for at the start of the podcast - why is TBL not the highly articulate and polished media performer ‘we’ (?) are now conditioned to expect from Silicon Valley?</p>
<p>These questions weren’t, to my mind, hostile questions so much as questions orthogonal to TBL’s personality, pursuits and interests. To Stewart and Campbell, not seeking to use one’s ability to maximise wealth, power and influence appeared simply not to make sense. The best explanation they could come up with was simply that TBL is <em>an eccentric</em>, though really this is just a (borderline derogatory) label rather than an explanation.</p>
<p>Having read the book, however, I think the real answer is that TBL is, was, and always will be deeply passionate about building and promoting systems that connect information, ideas, and people, and that so long as his material circumstances are never so adverse as to impinge on this lifelong calling, they will always be sufficient. Sometimes money helps, as with ensuring TBL’s web-standards body, W3O/W3C, remains financially afloat; but often it risks making the web ‘worse’, which to TBL seems to have consistently meant something like ‘able to allow free exchange of information’. One of TBL’s proudest achievements, for example, seems to have been to convince CERN to give the world http, in perpetuity, for free [p.&nbsp;103]; another was to fight, through W3C, for the web to never become <em>de-facto</em> proprietary through intentional disalignment on standards between browsers run by either Microsoft or Netscape, both of which wanted to introduce additions and features to ‘their version’ of the web which were incompatible with other providers. TBL doubtless had many opportunities to make decisions which would have have allowed him to own and profit from a more proprietary variant of the web (such as if he worked with Netscape to build ‘the new Netscape web’), but would have slowed down growth and access to the web: whenever given the choice between owning a larger share of a smaller pie, or owning but influencing a more vibrant and faster growing pie, he seems to have chosen the option that makes the web better, rather than himself richer. His vision, always, seems always to have been much grander than personal fortune or political power. If that’s ‘eccentric’ for Stewart and Campbell, then in a sense that speaks mainly to their lack of genuinely transcendent vision, rather than TBL’s inherent strangeness.</p>
</section>
<section id="idea-2-cern-and-http-is-organisational-efficiency-fundamentally-a-myth" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="idea-2-cern-and-http-is-organisational-efficiency-fundamentally-a-myth">Idea 2: CERN and http: Is organisational efficiency fundamentally a myth?</h2>
<p>I vaguely remember seeing and hearing an online lecture by TBL many years ago, where in his excitable, self-distracting, and frenetic style he said something like “I took my proposal [for http] to my line manager. He said ‘I don’t really understand what you’re talking about. Why not spend a few weeks working on it?’” Within the book I can’t find the exact same quote (which of course I might have confabulated), but there are still plenty of references to those around TBL have difficulty understanding his vision, and the proportionality and relevance of his proposals to his specific remit at CERN, but nevertheless recognising his passions and ability, and supporting him in developing his ideas into technologies.</p>
<p>To this end, TBL writes of effectively being ‘protected’ by his bosses and his bosses’ bosses, despite them often having little understanding of what he was doing.</p>
<p>What does this say for the very idea of organisational efficiency? Though there were likely some genuine benefits to developing http within CERN, the specific examples - such as being able to find people’s phone numbers, linked research publications, and brief biographies of fellow staff at CERN a bit more easily - may well have never, in a strict sense, have been proportionate to the cost of investment. If CERN had been a more ‘efficient’ organisation, an organisation where all costs and expenses have to be justified clearly within work programes and cost centres, and audited carefully to justify the organisation’s costs to the European tax payer, it may well have killed the web before it was ever born.</p>
<p>Even considering the discovery of the Higgs Boson, however, the web is almost certainly the most important contribution CERN has made, or will ever made, to humanity. And it would never have done this if CERN were a truly ‘efficient’ organisation. Is the very idea of organisational efficiency therefore something of a dangerous myth?</p>
<p>I suspect the answer’s both yes and no. Efficiency seems a useful concept when it’s clear what we want to maximise, but an horrific and crushing concept when we don’t. One idea I’ve been fascinated by for many years are fitness surface optimisation algorithms, and the ways that the most ‘efficient’ algorithms tend to lead us to local optima, rather than global optima, when the fitness surface is complex rather than simple. The most efficient approaches are akin to ‘blind hill climbers’: place one of these devices on a hill within the landscape we want to explore, and it will detect locally the gradient around it, and start trundling to ever higher elevation, until the top of the hill is reached. Then it will stop. But if the hill on which the hill-climber is placed is an undulation in the shadow of a mountain, it won’t see or detect the mountain, and forever find itself stuck on the hill instead. At every step along the way, the hill-climber can report incremental improvement, but it will never understand the broader landscape, and the opportunities that might present themselves if it were less ‘efficient’ and allowed occasionally to simply ‘wonder around’.</p>
<p>Any approach that allows the possibility of finding the global optima consistently will necessarily be less ‘efficient’. One approach is to employ an ensemble of hill-climbers, each dropped off in different locations of an invisible and unexplored landscape. (i.e.&nbsp;to give the algorithms different starting values.) If there were 10 hill climbers, and they all end up on the same place as a single hill climber, then ten times as much effort will have been spent on finding the same optima. Clearly very ‘inefficient’. But if one of the ten hill climbers happens to have started at the foot of the mountain, whereas the rest were all somewhere along the hill, and the mountain’s peak elevation is twenty times as that of the hill, then the reward will have been worth the additional effort.</p>
<p>Another, related, related approach is to intentionally build into the algorithms an element of ‘forgetfulness’ and ‘play’, which clearly seems a very inefficient thing to do. Think of these algorithms as more like ladybirds, with both a ‘flying’ phase and a ‘crawling’ phase. 95% of the time (say) the algorithms are in the crawling phase, and behave just like the standard hill climbers. But then 5% of the time these algorithms suddenly start flying around, and land somewhere completely different. Often, this means that the apparent progress towards the top of the last hill’s peak has been lost - something that seems very wasteful - but <em>maybe</em> during the flying phase the ladybird has found its way to an even higher section of the same hill; or found its way to the base of the mountain - the true global optima, rather than the local optima the simple hill climbers would have dutifully crawled.</p>
<p>By analogy, the most genuinely innovative organisations support staff to pursue both ‘flying’ and ‘crawling’, and to this extent trade-off some ‘efficiency’ for more possibility of creativity. Within large organisations, the freedom to fly has often found its way through permitting or actively promoting ‘skunkworks’. And within small tech outfits, through the idea of ‘pivoting’: recognising that an adjunct of one technology and use-case might actually be where the genuine value of a technology and business exists. Getting the balance right between flying and crawling is a perennial challenge, but to only value the measurable ‘efficiency’ of crawling over the immeasurable potential benefits of flying makes for a bad organisation and bad society.</p>

<section id="idea-3-top-down-and-bottom-up-modes-of-enterprise-need-to-know-how-to-dance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="idea-3-top-down-and-bottom-up-modes-of-enterprise-need-to-know-how-to-dance">Idea 3: Top down and bottom up modes of enterprise need to know how to dance</h2>
<p>The web (or rather http) is not the internet, which was developed in the US through military funding, before spreading through US universities. The military: top-down organisation based on hierarchy and standards operation processes; universities: bottom-up institutions based on exploration and emergent connections. Within the US, top-down started, then bottom-up followed.</p>
<p>Another theme of questions from Stewart and Campbell, once they’d tired of asking TBL why he wasn’t a billionaire, was “Why did the US, not Europe, capitalise so much on the European technology of the web?” The short answer seemed to be that the web was the next step of the internet dance that was taking place in US universities, and so the bottom-up, freewheeling sensibilities of these US research institutions were highly compatible with TBL’s vision of the web. Http was intended as a means of allowing people to tell machines something that people can identify easily but machines cannot: the way that data sources are connected and linked in the human mind. And it was intended to do so in a way that was akin to conversation: originally TBL wanted web pages to be editable by default, rather than just viewable, allowing new readers to themselves become editors, and find and refine the associations between nodes even further. Http was a lightweight framework offering a lot of possibilities for how people build links with each other. This open, democratic (but meritocratic) mentality was much more compatible with the often-anarchic researchers already using and familiar with the internet in US research institutions.</p>
<p>By contrast, it seems Europe was relatively reluctant to adopt the web for the same reasons the hippies and nerds over the Atlantic were keen on it: it was too <em>bottom-up</em>. The European instinct was instead to support and enforce a more top-down model of information sharing, based much more on conventions and standards. And conventions and standards mean meetings and bureaucracy, and meetings and bureaucracy takes <em>time</em> for deliberation and agreement. In short, it seems like Europe lost the advantage of its own technology by trying to <em>tame</em>, <em>organise</em> and <em>categorise</em> it, to make it work better in theory, rather than to adopt and use it in practice. After teaching the US a new series of dance moves, European bureaucracies then refused to dance any further.</p>

<section id="idea-4-the-web-was-for-information-not-engagement" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="idea-4-the-web-was-for-information-not-engagement">Idea 4: The Web was for Information, not Engagement</h2>
<p>For TBL, Wikipedia is the clearest working example of the web that he had envisaged. Wikipedia is not, by and large, a particularly <em>addictive</em> website. Instead, it’s something people will use to find information on something, and then once they’ve found that information, they will stop using it. Disengagement is therefore a <em>feature</em> of Wikipedia, not a <em>flaw</em> in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>But much of the modern web is the other way around: intended to <em>engage</em>, not to inform. The reasons for this are obvious once given the types of monetisation that have prevailed over the last twenty or so years: the profitability of a website is broadly proportional to the amount of time people spend on it, because users’ attention is the resource such companies sell to advertisers. Whereas the original aim of the web was to help people find what they are looking for, the engagement imperative of the commercial web instead militated towards almost the opposite: ensuring that users want more, but find less.</p>

<section id="idea-5-would-the-semantic-web-have-led-to-smarter-but-less-polite-ais" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="idea-5-would-the-semantic-web-have-led-to-smarter-but-less-polite-ais"><strong>Idea 5: Would the semantic web have led to smarter (but less polite) AIs?</strong></h2>
<p>Though the web itself saw explosive growth, some of TBL’s later ideas, promoted either personally or through the W3C, have found much less enthusiastic adoption. This includes what TBL referred to as ‘the Semantic Web’, or ‘Web 3.0’. In essence this was an argument, and a recommended set of standards, for embedding more machine readable data and information about associations between entities into websites. From the perspective of most viewers of a website, almost nothing would look any different. But within each site, so went the vision, was an extensive categorisation of information about entities and their relationships which a computer could understand. Eventually, if everyone building and maintaining websites went to the trouble of formally expressing information about what things are, and how they are are associated, then big thinking machines, crawling across the internet, could also become loaded up with all this information, and with enough entities, definitions, and associations, start to learn enough about the world to reason about it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the idea that individuals and businesses would go to a great deal of extra trouble to help computers know such facts as “Dresen is a city” and “Socrates is a man” was always fanciful, and so the concept was doomed from the get-go. TBL blames specific big players, like Microsoft, for not wanting to adopt semantic web standards, including RDF.</p>
<p>Perhaps modern LLMs, and how they work, has shown that the Semantic Web was not just unrealistic in terms of the amount of work it was expecting people to do behind the scenes to be nice to machines, but also turned out not to be especially valuable in helping machines to ‘think’ in any case.</p>
<p>There are broadly two paradigms guiding artificial intelligence research: semantic, and Markovian. The semantic paradigm was based around the idea that, if we explicitly instruct machines with enough facts and propositions, then eventually the machine will be able to take this nexus of information and reason on its own. The semantic web seems clearly most wedded this this paradigm for artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The Markovian paradigm, by contrast, just requires streams of text, or other forms of data. The text doesn’t have to say anything rational or sensible - it could exclusively comprise verbatim transcripts of the ramblings of Schizophrenics,, for example - but there does need to be a lot of it. From this paradigm, the intelligence of AI is - depending on perspective - illusory or emergent, and just comes about from the data getting processed ever more effectively and comprehensively to predict the next word, or the next sentence, or the next paragraph.</p>
<p>Of the two AI paradigms, the second definitely sounds a lot dumber. But over the past five years (at most) pretty much all progress in AI has come from researchers, mostly commercial, pursuing this second paradigm. The results have been spectacular, and perhaps indicate we just don’t need the kind of explicit reasoning and logical, rule-bound cogitation that the first paradigm, and the semantic web, appeared to presume were so important.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many LLMs are exquisite confabulators and bullshitters, able to generate vast amounts of prose that claim with apparent confidence things that are utterly untrue, rewriting history to suit the apparent whims and wishes of the user, referencing academic papers making impossible claims that don’t exist, and so on. Although the apparent reasonableness of most LLMs has increased, and continues to each year, the tendency for LLMs to veer off into unreason and mutual insanity when the flow of a conversation takes them that way, seems something inherent to the stream-based-next-token-generating paradigm they sit upon.</p>
<p>Perhaps, if the semantic web had been as popular in the 1990s and 2000s as the original web had been, the first paradigm for AI might have won the race instead, and we would now have AIs that are both terser and more rational?</p>
<p>There is one area in which the value proposition of meeting semantic web standards is relatively clear, however, and that relates to making the web more accessible for persons with, for example, visual impairments. A picture of an apple, for example, would need to be labelled as a picture of an apple in order for a screen reader to tell a user what the images contain. By making the contents of websites more accessible to machines, semantic web standards also help make contents more accessible to ever more people as well. Requirements to make more of the web more accessible have been growing in recent years, especially in the EU, and so perhaps it is through such mandates and requirements that the semantic web can still find fuel to grow.</p>

<section id="idea-6-household-microcultures-a-licence-to-be-uninhibited-in-eccentric-passion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="idea-6-household-microcultures-a-licence-to-be-uninhibited-in-eccentric-passion"><strong>Idea 6: Household Microcultures: A licence to be uninhibited in eccentric passion</strong></h2>
<p>If TBL appears eccentric, it’s likely partly because he is, and also because he was born and raised in a household environment where pursuits, preoccupations and interests that would strike most people as unusual were simply accepted. Both TBL’s parents were computer scientists and mathematicians, working in the nascent British computer industry of the 1950s. And both were highly creative systematisers, who fully supported TBL’s efforts as a child to build his own Heath Robinson-style computing device in the 1970s for the sheer sake of it, despite the risk of electrocution and exploding televisions.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The first thing I built was a switch for my model railway. Then I built an intercom that linked the upper and lower floors of the family house. (‘He was very useful as the engineer around the house’, Mum would later say.) I bought a ‘breadboard’, a simple physical platform for building circuits, and starting chaining together logic gates made from my cast-off transistors. You could make a circuit on the breadboard in minutes, and if it worked, you could solder it up on a printed circuit card to make it permanent. I made a train whistle circuit and some automation for the model trains. [pp.&nbsp;19-20]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TBL remembers his parents, who lived into their nineties, very fondly, despite occasionally being a victim of the downside of obsessive preoccupation:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Dad was brilliant, but he could be a little absent-minded. One time, he took me to pick up his shirts at the dry-cleaner’s. He got the shirts, but left me behind in my pushchair. Another time, he parked our car by an embankment on the Thames. He returned to find the tide washing over it. When he was travelling back to London from Manchester will colleagues one day, he could not find the return half of his train ticket at the barrier at the station. His colleagues assured the ticket inspector that he had just lost it and was always forgetting things. So he got home, and then my mother asked, ‘Conway, where’s the car?’ [pp.&nbsp;11-12]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For someone not similarly dispositioned to his parents, accounts like the above would have been grist for a misery memoir. For TBL, such incidents appear as fondly remembered as any others.</p>
</section>
<section id="idea-7-who-owns-my-data-double" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="idea-7-who-owns-my-data-double"><strong>Idea 7: Who owns my data double?</strong></h2>
<p>At the end of the TRIP Leading interview, Stewart picked up that TBL had become slightly frustrated with the types of question he had been asked (including implicit invitations to express envy and enmity towards billionaires and politicians), and asked (something like) “Is there anything you wish we had asked you?”</p>
<p>Somewhat regretfully, TBL stated (something like): “Well, I do wish you’d have asked more about the SOLID principles I’ve been developing and promoting the last few years:”</p>
<p>Much as the Semantic Web was TBL’s passion project in the late 1990s and 2000s, so in the 2010s and 2020s the question of personal data ownership - <em>cue bono</em>? - appears to have become TBL’s contemporary concern.</p>
<p>And with good reason, I’d suggest. If you’re not paying for a service, so the saying goes, you’re not the customer, you’re the product. And for companies like Facebook/Meta and Google the value of harvesting personal data is clearly estimable in the billions, with dividends returned to shareholders, not the users whose data are harvested. Meanwhile, inefficiencies and disconnects in many public and private services, lack of comprehensive and shared data about individuals, frequently leads to deeply frustrating experiences for those trying to get, for example, good quality healthcare, housing support, and financial services.</p>
<p>The problem, from TBL’s perspective, isn’t necessarily that too much, or too little, data is held about individuals, but that the individuals don’t own their own data. If individuals really did own their own data, they would have a clearer idea about how much such data are worth, and be able to make more informed and engaged decisions about how such data should be shared.</p>
<p>TBL tries, with some success, to articulate his vision as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Within the semantic web community, the idea of a ‘bit of the web of data which you own’ was becoming more and more desirable. So we built containers for our own data, and we called the containers Personal Online Data Stores, or ‘PODS’ [p.&nbsp;245]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We struggled to think of what to call [the PODS specification]… settling on ‘Social Linked Data’, or Solid… [p.&nbsp;245]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>With Solid we had an ecosystem where your pod would sit like a blank canvas, or an empty Scrabble board, waiting for apps to write facts into it. [p.&nbsp;245]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Solid layer would accomplish two things simultaneously. First, it would restore the privacy of the individual on the web, who would no longer have to worry what data was being generated about them, or who was looking at it. Second, it would unlock all manner of new functionality, by connecting data that had previously been stored in separate containers. [p.&nbsp;247]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For example, there were obviously huge benefits to be realized by attaching your smartwatch data to your medical records. If you were looking for new shows to watch, or new media to consume, you might attach your browsing history to a content recommendation algorithm. If you wanted to get a mortgage, you could attach your spending habits to your application. Maybe a travel agent would even be willing to pay you for access to information about the countries you’d visited and the restaurants you preferred. Of course, all of this was optional; if you were a privacy-oriented person, you would never have to share any of this information, and even if you did, you’d automatically be able to see who had access to anything you did share.

<p>As with the semantic web, such a shift in data ownership standards might seem both highly technical and highly idealistic (two terms at whose intersection is often found TBL) and we might struggle to imagine how we could conceivably get from here - where warring territories of international corporations own and profit from our data in separate proprietary cages - to there - where Solid PODS empower the individual to choose what to share with third parties. It could come about, perhaps, if such a shift to Solid PODS were shown to enrich and empower all stakeholders - individuals, public services, private corporations alike - much as people tend to stick to the same rule of which side of the road to drive on for their benefit as much as others; and almost everyone agrees that some taxation is acceptable to pay for, at least, basic physical infrastructure and national security. Similarly, it could become adopted if a coalition of corporate underdogs - the second, third and forth largest companies, collectively owning 70% of personal data - adopts it to challenge the top dog. Or because a province, then a state, then a country, then a continent, adopts it first for public services, and at each stage the benefits in terms of reduced data friction and improved services are demonstrated.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="idea-8-apps-the-walled-gardens-of-the-modern-web"><strong>Idea 8: Apps: The Walled Gardens of the Modern Web</strong></h2>
<p>To an extent, phone apps are just little wrappers around pieces of web content. But as TBL came to realise, in practice they’re something much more, and much worse:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I think the mobile experience would have been greatly improved if you didn’t have to download an app every time you wanted to engage with a new service. Interestingly, that’s what Steve Jobs seemed to first showcase with the iPhone.. If you watch his original presentation for the device, from 2007, he repeatedly demonstrates the unlimited functionality of the iPhone’s Safari browser. The app store wouldn’t launch for more than a year.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Why did Jobs change direction? The answer was suggested to me at a clandestine rendezvous I had in the late 2000s with a Google engineer who shall remain unnamed. We met at a restaurant at Half Moon Bay, a popular beach town across the mountains from Silicon Valley. At a quiet table overlooking the ocean, the engineer explained to me that, from what he could see from deep inside Google, Apple was deliberately throttling the functionality of both the Safari and Chrome mobile browsers. Apple, you see, got a 30 per cent commission of the apps it sold; plus, it received continuing income from subscriptions and in-app purchases. It was much more profitable for Apple to direct the developers to build an app than to build a mobile website. Apple got a cut from the former, and nothing from the latter.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I considered what he was saying as I stared out into the Pacific. He was right, of course …[p.&nbsp;226]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TBL then concludes:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Apple app store was an example of exactly the kind of for-profit gatekeeping I’d always hoped the web could navigate around. But the iPhone was extraordinarily popular - I owned one myself. The toll booths the web had managed to avoid on the PC had found their way into the mobile realm.</p>

<p>My last observation may strike the reader as somewhat facetious or <em>ad hominem</em>, because it is. But it was something that struck me, as ‘interesting’ at least, while reading the book.</p>
<p>Part way through, I lost count of the number of wives TBL has had, and became somewhat bemused by how casually he discussed the ending of each relationship, as well as non-professional relationships in general. I am fairly the answer is three. But each coupling and uncoupling - except the last - is mentioned with such parenthetic insouciance as to give each status change a kind of ‘blink-and-you-miss-it’ quality.</p>
<p>On TBL’s first wife, whom he met at Oxford:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When my time at CERN was over, I saved the Enquire program to an 8-inch floppy disk, then entrusted it to Brian Carpenter. I included with the disk a five-page written explanation of what it was, and what it did. It wasn’t the last time I would see Brian Carpenter, but it was the last time I would see the disk. Our contracts were up and we returned to Poole. Sometime after, Jane and I decided to end our marriage and go our separate ways. [p.&nbsp;40]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, even decades later, TBL still appears bereft… about losing the disk containing a search program he’d written called enquire-within.</p>
<p>On meeting TBL’s second wife:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>While living in Switzerland, I met Nancy Carlson, an American working as an analyst at the World Health Organisation headquarters in Geneva. We moved in together and, a few years later, we married. Nancy worked with computers, too, and at home we shared a 286 Toshiba laptop. The personal computing revolution of the 1980s was well underway, and it was no longer necessary to build your own computer. I left my beloved homebrew computer behind in Poole; and in the mad rush to leave for CERN, I ended up throwing it out. (Kevin, the photographer of the group, took some photos of it.) In my apartment in Switzerland, I was content with a PC clone. [p.&nbsp;44]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in the paragraph describing his meeting and marrying his second wife, TBL does use the term ‘beloved’… to describe the homebrew computer he discarded in Poole.</p>
<p>Writing about attending a trip to Finland to receive the Innaugural Millenium Technology Prize, TBL writes:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Finnish visit was one of the last official trips I took with Nancy. Our marriage in fact came to an end over the next few years, and I was hopeful for new horizons in my work and personal life [p.&nbsp;192]</p>

<p>Two children, almost two decades of marriage, but time for Tim to move on. <em>With whom</em> is conveyed through some possibly inadvertent foreshadowing, in which Tim devotes more than a single sentence to a woman he knows (other than his mother):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I first met Rosemary Leith at a dinner in 2008. The hosts were my friends Nigel Shadbolt and Wendy Hall, two professors at the University of Southampton. Nigel, Wendy and I were all on the board of the Web Science Trust, a charitable trust which supports interdisciplinary research into the effects the web has on society at large. They were courting Rosemary to join our board.</p>
<p>Rosemary was a highly accomplished businesswoman with an enormous gift in her ability to connect with people and understand how they think. She holds others and herself to a very high standard. She had grown up in Canada, then moved to the UK via Switzerland in the late 1980s to work for the private equity firm Pallas. In the late 1990s, she co-founded an early content company called Flametree, a dot-com that took advantage of web technology to provide flexible work-life solutions. Rosemary and her co-founder were very far ahead of their time; both had relied on flex-work in order to succeed in business while simultaneously raising children. Flametree was a success, and in 2001 they sold it to PwC just three years after inception. Rosemary then worked as a venture investor, using her ability to recognize early shifts in society that impacted technology and to see their resulting commercial impact.</p>
<p>I found in Rosemary a strong-willed, highly intelligent woman. She had dark hair, dark eyes and a winning smile. I liked her right away, and I began inventing reasons to see her again. I had a TED talk comping up and, although I didn’t know her very well, I asked her to help me write it. I believe she was a bit skeptical of me at first - but why don’t I let her tell this part of the story? [pp.&nbsp;204-205]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There then follows another page in which Tim quotes Rosemary lavishing praise on Tim.</p>
<p>Then, in the world’s most predictable plot development:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Years later, in 2014, when I asked Rosemary to marry me, the Queen gave us permission to use the Chapel Royal, dating from Henry VIII’s time, and the adjoining St James’s Palace, as our venue. [p.&nbsp;228]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many years ago, I remember listening to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p06n2nfl">an episode of Radio 4’s public statistics programme, More or Less</a>, discussing divorce rates within straight (or ‘mixed sex’) couples, as well as amongst gay men, and gay women. The key finding surprised me enough to have been burned in my consciousness ever since.</p>
<p>The key finding was this: Lesbian divorce rates are the substantially <em>higher</em> than divorce rates in mixed-sex couples, which are substantially higher than divorce rates amongst Gay Men. The researcher who crunched the numbers was interviewed, and matter-of-factly stated something like, “this was an expected result, as in mixed-sex couples it is more likely to be the female partner who initiates divorce proceedings, so in a sense we have in a Lesbian marriage a ‘double dose’ of partners with an increased proclivity to initiate divorce proceedings.” This finding is perhaps not we might expect if we assume divorce occurs mainly through something like a personality-mismatch pathway, in which inherent differences between male-typical and female-typical personality profiles would be expected to be greatest in mixed-sex couples, leading to the greatest level of conflict leading to divorce.</p>
<p>Now, though I think this higher-female-propensity-to-divorce tendency likely <em>is</em> true amongst most marriages, I think there may be an exception to this ‘rule’: amongst ‘high status’ (and rising status) males, I suspect it may be the male partner of a mixed-sex marriage who becomes more likely to divorce or separate (or at least to become increasingly inattentive, leading to the female partner to initiate divorce or separation proceedings). <em>Why?</em> Because someone who over the course of a marriage or other long-term relationship gains substantially in status and success also gains in <em>partner options</em>, i.e.&nbsp;the number of other people who may seek or be receptive to advances from ‘high status’ individuals. And, given polygyny (the marriage of one to many) is near-universally proscribed within modern societies, the caricatured response to these growing status-based opportunities for partners is for high status men (especially, but I suspect some women too) to ‘trade up’ through serial monogomy, multiple marriages, instead.</p>
<p>So, my suspicion is TBL’s multiple marriages may well fit this cliched pattern amongst ‘successful high status men’. So far, so disappointingly familiar. Three somewhat redeeming aspects to TBL’s own version of this pattern, however: firstly, that he never seems to have anything negative or critical to say about his previous wives (if in part because, at least in this autobiography, he has little to say about them at all); secondly, that he appears immensely proud and devoted to his children from previous marriages; and thirdly, that those traits he sought to ‘trade up’ in in his partners were those of professional success and ambition rather than youthfulness (see <a href="https://graziadaily.co.uk/celebrity/news/leonardo-dicaprio-dating-history/">DiCaprio’s Immortal Girlfriend</a>, for example), physical attractiveness, and subservience.</p>
</section>
<section id="summary" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>So, there’s nine somewhat-random-and-scattershot ideas prompted by TBL’s book, and the podcast by which I became aware of it. Near the start I mentioned that I’m somewhat jaundiced by works of industrialist hagiography, hence not taking to Bregman’s <em>Moral Ambition</em>, and there are certainly aspects of <em>This is for Everyone</em> that could fit within this mould. Like Helen Lewis, I also rate highly Steven Johnson’s arguments about the <em>adjacent possible</em>, the concept that new ideas have their time and place, and it can often be little more than accident who takes credit for their discovery, as an antidote to excess beliefs that, but for a scattering of great individuals throughout history, we would still be banging rocks together. But at the same time, in this reality at least, I think there are clear, obdurate, and positive ways in which the specific form of the digitally connected world in which we all live - such as those related to interoperability and net neutrality - continue to be shaped by the flavour of interconnectivity brought by TBL’s vision in the late 1980s, rather than some - perhaps more profit-minded - also-ran who would have stepped into the <em>adjacent possible</em> if, for example, TBL’s bosses at CERN were not as forgiving of his idiosyncracies and reveries as they turned out to be.</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>The tl;dr: like many breathless works of hagiography, <em>Moral Ambition</em> struck me as monotone, valourising a personality profile that, in certain lights, sure looks pathological. Whereas ‘great man’ accounts running from Galton’s 19th century proto-eugenics work <em>Hereditary Genius</em>, and through to ‘titans of industry’ books of the 20th century, and into ‘cyberindustrialist’ books of the 21st century, valourise cognitively gifted monomanaics’ pursuit of wealth and growth in the private sector, Bregman’s <em>Moral Ambition</em> seems to employ exactly the same formula in valourising the same gifted-obsessive profile in the public and third sector.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Note from Claude: Tim Berners-Lee’s autobiography <em>This is For Everyone</em> was published in September 2024. The book chronicles both his personal journey and the development of the World Wide Web, which he invented in 1989 while working at CERN. Berners-Lee was knighted in 2004 and is currently a professor at MIT and the University of Oxford, where he continues to advocate for an open, decentralized web through his work with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Foundation. I’d ordered the book within a few minutes of the podcast ending, and finished reading it in about three days (which is fast for me).↩︎</p></li>

<p>Compared with OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demis_Hassabis">Demis Hassabis</a>, the cofounder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_DeepMind">DeepMind</a>, is perhaps less well know amongst the general public. However, after watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32150119/">The Thinking Game</a> recently, the 2024 documentary tracking DeepMind’s staggering progress towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGIs), Hassabis may well turn out to have been the more impactful in the course of human cultural and technological evolution. Founding the company in 2010 with the modest goal of ‘solving intelligence’, DeepMind was then acquired by Google in 2014 for an unfathomable amount of money, after being able to show remarkable success in teaching AIs to solve complex but well defined goal-orientated activities.</p>
<p>These complex but well defined goal-orientated activities: playing computer games, where the goals can be as simple as ‘win points’, but means of achieving this are anywhere but simple. Starting from Atari games from the late 1970s and 1980s, Alpha, DeepMind’s insatiably improving megatech, initially struggled, like any infant, to even know how to move a paddle up or down on a screen. But before too long it had learned to play an increasingly complex array of 8 bit games to greater standards than any human.</p>
<p>Hassabis is still fairly young, looks younger still, and appears to have lived many remarkable lives of precocious intellectual supremacy: a prize winning chess champion before the age of 10, completing secondary education a year early, and needing to wait a year before Oxford was legally permitted to admit him, he won a place at Peter Molyneux’ early 90s games powerhouse, Bullfrog, where he co-designed, and wrote the AI for, a game called Theme Park. He then turned down an offer of a million pounds to <em>not</em> attend university and continue coding games, because the Oxbridge degree was an essential part of his longer term vision.</p>
<p>Step ahead to the late 2000s. Hassabis - game player, game developer, computer scientist, and now neuroscientist - calmly and quietly explains firstly that his company aims to ‘solve intelligence’, and ‘produce an Artificial General Intelligence’, and secondly the types of modelling approach he thinks will achieve this aim.</p>
<p>Step ahead to 2020. Alpha has beaten the finest Go players in the world, a game recognised to be orders of magnitude harder for computers to master than Chess; it’s also almost unbeatable at StarCraft, a real time tactics game that has become an esports stalwart. Much more critically, it’s solved what may be the hardest game life has to offer: protein folding, predicting what kind of complex three dimensional structure is likely to emerge from a linear chain of amino acids, a problem that had represented a bottleneck on basic pharmaceutical and biological research for generations.</p>
<p>Step forward to 2024. Hassabis is a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.<sup>1</sup> AlphaFold has predicted the protein structure of almost every protein ever discovered. Rather than hoarding such knowledge, perhaps equivalent to millennia of human endeavour, DeepMind releases all predictions.</p>
<p>Although it may be OpenAI’s ChatGPT which showed the potential of AIs to the general public, to me the kinds of advances DeepMind have made seem much more impressive, and to offer a much stronger foundation for advancing towards a true <em>general</em> intelligence, based on very specific and measurable goals and aims, rather than in producing the kind of mellifluous sycophantic confabulation that LLMs tend to be (in)famous for. Real general intelligence, whether from ‘artificial’ origins or not, must be about more than the ability to endlessly produce sweet-sounding bullshit and uncanny slop.</p>
<p>Maybe I was too harsh on LLMs just then. My apologies. As penance, here’s a kind of exploratory reverie I had with Claude, which gives the appearance of being comparatively low in confabulation and sycophancy - to help reflect on the documentary:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What do protein folding problems entail? Why has this historically been such a challenge? What are the possible acceleration in scientific advances that should result over the next 1-10 years from Alpha’s work in this area?</p>
</blockquote>
<section id="the-protein-folding-problem" class="level1">
<h1><strong>The Protein Folding Problem</strong></h1>
<p>Protein folding is one of biology’s most fundamental puzzles: predicting how a protein’s amino acid sequence determines its three-dimensional structure. This matters because a protein’s shape dictates its function—enzymes, antibodies, structural components, and virtually every biological process depends on proteins adopting the correct 3D configuration.</p>
<section id="what-the-problem-entails" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-the-problem-entails"><strong>What the Problem Entails</strong></h2>
<p>The challenge has several layers:</p>
<p><strong>The fundamental question</strong>: Given a linear sequence of amino acids (the primary structure), can we predict how it will fold into its final 3D shape (tertiary structure)? Proteins can fold into incredibly complex configurations with helices, sheets, loops, and intricate binding sites.</p>
<p><strong>The astronomical complexity</strong>: A typical protein might have 100-300 amino acids. Even if each amino acid could adopt just 3 conformations, that’s 3^100 possible structures—more than the number of atoms in the universe. Yet proteins fold correctly in milliseconds to seconds inside cells.</p>
<p><strong>The physics</strong>: Folding is driven by countless weak interactions—hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic effects, electrostatic forces, van der Waals interactions. Simulating all these forces accurately requires immense computational power, and even then, the timescales involved (microseconds to seconds) were beyond reach for most proteins.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-its-been-so-hard" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-its-been-so-hard"><strong>Why It’s Been So Hard</strong></h2>
<p>For decades, scientists faced multiple obstacles:</p>
<p><strong>Experimental methods are slow and expensive</strong>: Determining protein structures through X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy takes months to years and doesn’t work for all proteins. Many important proteins (like membrane proteins) are extremely difficult to crystallize.</p>
<p><strong>Computational approaches struggled</strong>: Traditional molecular dynamics simulations could model only microseconds of folding for small proteins. Ab initio prediction methods that tried to calculate structures from first principles were computationally intractable.</p>
<p><strong>The gap between sequence and structure</strong>: By 2020, we knew sequences for hundreds of millions of proteins but had experimental structures for only about 170,000. This enormous gap limited our understanding of biology and medicine.</p>
</section>
<section id="alphafolds-breakthrough-and-future-impact" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="alphafolds-breakthrough-and-future-impact"><strong>AlphaFold’s Breakthrough and Future Impact</strong></h2>
<p>AlphaFold2 (2020) and AlphaFold3 (2024) have revolutionized this field by using deep learning to predict structures with near-experimental accuracy. Here’s what this enables over the next 1-10 years:</p>
<p><strong>Drug discovery acceleration</strong>: Understanding protein structures allows pharmaceutical companies to design drugs that fit precisely into binding sites. This could compress drug development timelines from 10-15 years to potentially 5-7 years for some targets, and open up “undruggable” targets that were previously too difficult to work with.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding disease mechanisms</strong>: Many diseases involve misfolded proteins (Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, cystic fibrosis). Predicting how mutations affect folding helps us understand pathology and design therapies. We’re already seeing this with personalized medicine approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Enzyme engineering</strong>: Researchers can now design novel enzymes for industrial processes—breaking down plastics, producing biofuels, synthesizing chemicals more sustainably. What once required years of trial-and-error can now be guided by structural predictions.</p>
<p><strong>Synthetic biology</strong>: Designing new proteins from scratch becomes feasible. Scientists are creating novel proteins for carbon capture, biosensors, and new materials. This could lead to programmable biological systems.</p>
<p><strong>Antibody design</strong>: Faster development of therapeutic antibodies and vaccines. Understanding antibody-antigen interactions at atomic resolution accelerates development of treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Basic research acceleration</strong>: Biologists can now generate hypotheses about protein function instantly rather than waiting months for experimental structures. This fundamentally speeds up the research cycle across molecular biology, genetics, and biochemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Structural proteomics</strong>: AlphaFold has already predicted structures for over 200 million proteins—essentially all known proteins. This creates a comprehensive map of the protein universe, revealing evolutionary relationships and functional patterns never before visible.</p>
<p>The most profound impact may be how this changes the nature of biological research itself. Structure prediction becomes a routine computational step rather than a bottleneck, allowing scientists to ask bigger questions and test more hypotheses. Combined with other AI advances in protein design, gene editing, and systems biology, we’re entering an era where biology becomes more predictable and engineering-driven—potentially as transformative as the transition from alchemy to modern chemistry.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When discussing ‘sites’/‘targets’, is the lock-and-key analogy appropriate, with the challenge being that given the amino acid sequence alone neither the lock nor key structure was previously known?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the lock-and-key analogy is quite appropriate and captures the essence of the challenge beautifully!</p>
</section>
<section id="the-lock-and-key-model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-lock-and-key-model"><strong>The Lock-and-Key Model</strong></h2>
<p>The analogy works well for understanding molecular recognition. Proteins often have specific binding sites (the “lock”) where other molecules—drugs, substrates, other proteins, DNA, etc. (the “key”)—fit with high specificity. The shape complementarity, along with chemical properties like charge distribution and hydrophobicity, determines whether binding occurs and how strong it is.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-double-blind-problem" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-double-blind-problem"><strong>The Double-Blind Problem</strong></h2>
<p>Your insight about the double challenge is exactly right. Historically, drug designers faced a frustrating situation:</p>
<p><strong>Without knowing the lock’s shape</strong>, you couldn’t rationally design a key. You’d have to try thousands or millions of chemical compounds hoping something would fit—essentially trying random keys in a lock you couldn’t see. This “high-throughput screening” approach is expensive, time-consuming, and often misses good candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Even when you had a target sequence</strong>, you didn’t know what 3D structure it would adopt, so you couldn’t predict where the binding site would be, what shape it would have, or which chemical properties would matter for binding.</p>
<p>It’s like being asked to design a key for a lock when all you have is the manufacturing instruction manual written in code, with no picture of the actual lock.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-alphafold-changes-the-game" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-alphafold-changes-the-game"><strong>How AlphaFold Changes the Game</strong></h2>
<p>Now with structure prediction, researchers can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>See the lock’s shape from the amino acid sequence alone</p></li>
<li><p>Identify binding pockets and cavities computationally</p></li>
<li><p>Understand which amino acids line the binding site</p></li>
<li><p>Design molecules that complement that specific geometry</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This transforms drug discovery from a “blind search” into a “rational design” problem.</p>
</section>
<section id="refining-the-analogy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="refining-the-analogy"><strong>Refining the Analogy</strong></h2>
<p>That said, the lock-and-key metaphor has some limitations worth noting:</p>
<p><strong>Induced fit</strong>: Proteins aren’t rigid locks. They’re often flexible and change shape when the key binds—more like a glove conforming to a hand than a rigid lock. This dynamic behavior adds complexity that AlphaFold is increasingly capturing.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple conformations</strong>: Proteins can adopt different shapes (conformational states), essentially changing the lock’s shape depending on conditions. Some proteins have “open” and “closed” states, or undergo large structural rearrangements.</p>
<p><strong>Allosteric sites</strong>: Sometimes the best “lock” isn’t the active site at all, but a distant site that, when bound, changes the protein’s shape or function. These regulatory mechanisms add another layer of sophistication.</p>
<p>But fundamentally, yes—you’ve captured the core problem perfectly. AlphaFold reveals the lock’s structure from its genetic blueprint, making rational key design possible for the first time at scale.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Given the suggested decline in drug development from 10-15 to 5-7 years, what are the remaining steps that take the 4-6 years?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great question! Even with perfect structural knowledge, drug development remains a lengthy, complex process. Here’s what fills those remaining 5-7 years:</p>
</section>
<section id="the-remaining-timeline" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-remaining-timeline"><strong>The Remaining Timeline</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Lead Optimization (1-2 years)</strong> Even after identifying a molecule that fits the binding site, you need to optimize it. The initial “hit” might bind well but have terrible properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Poor solubility (can’t dissolve in blood)</p></li>
<li><p>Rapid metabolism (body breaks it down too quickly)</p></li>
<li><p>Toxicity to human cells</p></li>
<li><p>Inability to cross cell membranes or reach the target tissue</p></li>
<li><p>Off-target effects (binds to unintended proteins)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Medicinal chemists iterate through hundreds of variants, tweaking the structure to improve these properties while maintaining binding affinity. Structure prediction helps but doesn’t solve pharmacokinetics (how the drug moves through the body) or toxicity.</p>
<p><strong>Preclinical Testing (1-2 years)</strong> Before human trials, extensive animal studies are required:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Toxicology studies in multiple species</p></li>
<li><p>Pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion)</p></li>
<li><p>Safety profiling at various doses</p></li>
<li><p>Efficacy testing in disease models</p></li>
<li><p>Manufacturing process development</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These can’t be fully simulated—you must observe actual biological responses in living systems.</p>
<p><strong>Phase I Clinical Trials (1-2 years)</strong> First tests in humans, usually 20-100 healthy volunteers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is it safe at various doses?</p></li>
<li><p>How does the human body process it?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the side effects?</p></li>
<li><p>What’s the maximum tolerated dose?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>About 70% of drugs fail here despite looking promising in animals.</p>
<p><strong>Phase II Clinical Trials (1-2 years)</strong> Testing in 100-300 patients who actually have the disease:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does it work in humans?</p></li>
<li><p>What’s the optimal dose?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the side effects in sick patients?</p></li>
<li><p>Early efficacy signals</p></li>
</ul>
<p>About 33% of drugs that passed Phase I fail here.</p>
<p><strong>Phase III Clinical Trials (2-4 years)</strong> Large-scale trials with 300-3,000+ patients:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definitively prove efficacy compared to standard treatment or placebo</p></li>
<li><p>Comprehensive safety data across diverse populations</p></li>

<p><strong>Safety requirements</strong>: You can’t simulate whether a drug causes liver damage, heart problems, or cancer over time. This requires observing actual patients for months or years.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical rigor</strong>: Clinical trials need sufficient patient numbers and follow-up time to prove the drug works and is safe. A drug might show early promise but fail in larger populations or reveal rare but serious side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Manufacturing scale-up</strong>: Making grams in a lab differs vastly from producing tons reliably and consistently. This process development happens in parallel but takes years.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory conservatism</strong>: After disasters like thalidomide, regulators rightfully demand extensive proof. The bar is high, and shortcuts have catastrophic consequences.</p>

<p>Beyond structure prediction, AI could potentially compress timelines by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Predicting toxicity and drug properties computationally (reducing trial-and-error in optimization)</p></li>
<li><p>Identifying biomarkers for patient selection (making trials more efficient)</p></li>
<li><p>Optimizing trial design and patient recruitment</p></li>
<li><p>Predicting drug-drug interactions and side effects</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But the irreducible core—proving safety and efficacy in actual human beings over time—remains. Biology is messy, patients are variable, and rare side effects only emerge in large populations.</p>
<p>That said, going from 10-15 years to 5-7 years would be transformative. It means patients get treatments roughly twice as fast, development costs drop significantly (making more “niche” drugs economically viable), and pharmaceutical companies can tackle more targets with the same resources. The impact compounds across the entire healthcare ecosystem.</p>

<section id="arguments-for-faster-growth" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="arguments-for-faster-growth"><strong>Arguments for Faster Growth</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Improved R&amp;D productivity</strong>: The pharmaceutical industry has suffered from declining R&amp;D efficiency for decades—“Eroom’s Law” (Moore’s Law backwards). Despite spending more on R&amp;D, fewer drugs were approved per billion dollars spent. If AlphaFold and related AI tools reverse this trend, companies could get more successful drugs from the same investment.</p>
<p><strong>Expanded druggable targets</strong>: Many disease-causing proteins were previously “undruggable” because we couldn’t understand their structure well enough to design inhibitors. Suddenly having access to 200+ million protein structures could open entirely new therapeutic areas—particularly in rare diseases and precision medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Faster time-to-market</strong>: Getting drugs approved in 5-7 years instead of 10-15 years means:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Earlier revenue generation</p></li>
<li><p>Longer effective patent life (more years of exclusivity)</p></li>
<li><p>Lower cost of capital (less money tied up for shorter periods)</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to pursue more projects simultaneously</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Better capital allocation</strong>: Companies can computationally filter out likely failures earlier, concentrating resources on more promising candidates.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="arguments-against-faster-growth-or-why-it-might-not-matter-as-much"><strong>Arguments Against Faster Growth (or Why It Might Not Matter as Much)</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Competition intensifies equally</strong>: Every pharma company gets access to the same tools. If everyone becomes more efficient simultaneously, the competitive advantage disappears. This could lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>More drugs reaching market (supply increase)</p></li>
<li><p>Increased pricing pressure as multiple companies target the same diseases</p></li>
<li><p>Faster erosion of market share as competitors develop alternatives more quickly</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Value accrues elsewhere</strong>: The companies capturing value might not be traditional pharma:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AI biotech startups using these tools</p></li>
<li><p>Tech companies (Google/DeepMind, etc.) that own the platforms</p></li>
<li><p>Contract research organizations (CROs) that offer AI-enabled services</p></li>
<li><p>Generic manufacturers who can more quickly develop biosimilars</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Regulatory and pricing pressure</strong>: Governments and insurers are increasingly aggressive about drug pricing. Even if companies develop drugs faster and cheaper, they may not be able to charge proportionally more. In fact, regulators might argue that lower development costs should mean lower prices.</p>
<p><strong>The clinical trial bottleneck remains</strong>: As we discussed, 5-7 years of the timeline can’t be compressed much. So while early-stage productivity improves dramatically, the rate-limiting step (human trials) doesn’t change proportionally. The benefit is real but perhaps more incremental than revolutionary.</p>
<p><strong>Market saturation</strong>: Many “easy” and lucrative targets (common diseases in wealthy populations) already have treatments. New drugs increasingly target:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rare diseases (smaller markets)</p></li>
<li><p>Precision medicine (fragmented patient populations)</p></li>
<li><p>Diseases more common in lower-income countries (pricing challenges)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The innovation paradox</strong>: As medicine advances, we’re left with harder problems. The remaining diseases are often more complex, multifactorial, or involve targets that are difficult to modulate without side effects.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="historical-context-the-last-20-30-years"><strong>Historical Context: The Last 20-30 Years</strong></h2>
<p>Looking backward provides useful perspective:</p>
<p><strong>Pharmaceutical stocks have grown, but inconsistently</strong>: Large-cap pharma has roughly tracked or slightly outperformed the broader market over 20-30 years, but with high volatility tied to patent cliffs, pipeline failures, and blockbuster approvals. Biotech has been more variable—spectacular winners but many complete failures.</p>
<p><strong>The industry has consolidated</strong>: Much of the “growth” came through mergers and acquisitions rather than organic innovation, suggesting structural challenges in R&amp;D productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Previous technological revolutions had mixed impacts</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Genomics (Human Genome Project, 2003) was supposed to revolutionize drug discovery. Results have been real but slower than expected.</p></li>
<li><p>High-throughput screening, combinatorial chemistry, and other tools improved efficiency but didn’t fundamentally change growth trajectories.</p></li>
<li><p>Monoclonal antibodies and biologics created huge value, but much of it accrued to a few companies with platform advantages.</p></li>

</section>
<section id="the-realistic-scenario" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-realistic-scenario"><strong>The Realistic Scenario</strong></h2>
<p>My best guess is <strong>moderate acceleration rather than explosive growth</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Near-term (3-5 years)</strong>: Traditional pharma companies will see improved R&amp;D metrics—higher success rates, better target selection, reduced costs in early stages. Stock performance will likely improve modestly, but much of this may already be priced in by forward-looking investors.</p>
<p><strong>Medium-term (5-10 years)</strong>: We’ll see the first wave of “AI-designed” drugs reaching market. Winners will be companies that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Integrated AI tools most effectively into their workflows</p></li>
<li><p>Combined computational power with deep biological/clinical expertise</p></li>
<li><p>Maintained or built strong data assets (patient data, trial results, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Adapted organizational culture to new ways of working</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This could create differentiated returns—some companies pull ahead while others lag.</p>
<p><strong>Long-term questions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does value concentrate (a few winners dominate) or fragment (many specialized players)?</p></li>
<li><p>Do tech companies enter pharma directly or just sell tools?</p></li>
<li><p>How do regulatory frameworks and pricing policies adapt?</p></li>
<li><p>Does AI-enabled drug development become commoditized (eliminating competitive advantage)?</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-contrarian-take" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-contrarian-take"><strong>The Contrarian Take</strong></h2>
<p>There’s a scenario where pharmaceutical <em>stock returns</em> don’t improve much despite massive scientific progress:</p>
<p>If development becomes much cheaper and faster, <strong>barriers to entry fall</strong>. More companies can afford to develop drugs. Competition increases. Pricing power decreases. The consumer/patient wins (more treatments, lower costs), but shareholders don’t necessarily benefit proportionally. The economic surplus gets distributed to patients and healthcare systems rather than captured by pharma companies.</p>
<p>This has precedent—many technological revolutions (personal computers, solar panels, LED lighting) delivered enormous societal value but became commoditized industries with modest profit margins.</p>
</section>
<section id="bottom-line" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bottom-line"><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2>
<p>Scientific progress doesn’t automatically translate to outsized stock returns. The key questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Can individual companies create sustainable competitive advantages?</p></li>
<li><p>How much of the value gets captured by pharma vs.&nbsp;distributed to other stakeholders?</p></li>
<li><p>Does increased efficiency get competed away?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’d expect pharma to grow <strong>somewhat faster</strong> than the last 20-30 years—perhaps adding 1-3% annually to returns relative to historical performance—but not the explosive multiples you might expect from such a fundamental breakthrough. The biggest winners might be AI-native biotech companies and platforms rather than traditional pharma giants, though the latter have capital and infrastructure advantages for clinical development and commercialization.</p>
<p>The real beneficiaries will be patients and society through better treatments arriving faster and more diseases becoming treatable. Whether that translates to proportional shareholder returns remains genuinely uncertain.</p>

<p>Are allosteric sites essentially upstream sites in terms of causal influence on downstream protein structure, or is a different mental model more suited to understanding this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “upstream causal influence” framing is partially correct but misses some key aspects. Let me offer a more nuanced mental model.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-upstream-works-sort-of" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-upstream-works-sort-of"><strong>Why “Upstream” Works (Sort Of)</strong></h2>
<p>Allosteric sites do exert causal influence on function, and there is a sense of information flow:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ligand binds to allosteric site → conformational change propagates → active site changes shape/activity</p></li>
<li><p>This creates a regulatory pathway: the allosteric site acts as a control knob</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So yes, in terms of signal transduction and regulatory logic, “upstream” captures something real.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-upstream-is-misleading" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-upstream-is-misleading"><strong>Why “Upstream” Is Misleading</strong></h2>
<p><strong>It’s not strictly hierarchical</strong>: The relationship isn’t like a linear pathway where A causes B causes C. Instead, it’s more like a <strong>mechanical coupling</strong> or <strong>network of interactions</strong>. Think of it less like a signal cascade and more like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>A network of springs and struts</strong>: When you pull on one part of an interconnected structure, the strain propagates throughout, causing distant parts to shift position. The allosteric site doesn’t “send a signal” so much as it perturbs the entire mechanical/energetic landscape.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Energetic redistribution</strong>: Proteins exist in multiple conformational states, constantly fluctuating. The allosteric ligand doesn’t create new structures—it <em>shifts the equilibrium</em> between pre-existing conformations. It stabilizes certain states and destabilizes others, changing the probability distribution of shapes the protein adopts.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="better-mental-models" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="better-mental-models"><strong>Better Mental Models</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Conformational ensemble</strong>: Proteins aren’t static structures but dynamic populations. Imagine the protein as existing in multiple shapes simultaneously (like a quantum superposition, though the mechanism is classical):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>State A: 70% of molecules, active site “open”</p></li>
<li><p>State B: 30% of molecules, active site “closed”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An allosteric ligand binding might shift this to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>State A: 20% (now disfavored)</p></li>
<li><p>State B: 80% (now favored)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The allosteric site doesn’t cause the closed state—it already existed—but it changes which state predominates.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical linkage</strong>: Think of proteins like intricate origami or mechanical linkages where:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Different domains are connected by flexible hinges and rigid segments</p></li>
<li><p>Binding at one site constrains certain degrees of freedom</p></li>
<li><p>This constraint propagates through the structure via physical connections</p></li>
<li><p>Distant regions adjust to accommodate the new constraints</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, many enzymes have domains connected by hinge regions. When an allosteric regulator binds, it might lock a hinge in place, forcing other domains to adopt specific relative orientations.</p>
<p><strong>Energy landscapes</strong>: Proteins navigate a rugged energy landscape with multiple valleys (stable conformations) separated by hills (energy barriers). The allosteric ligand:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deepens some valleys (stabilizes certain conformations)</p></li>
<li><p>Raises others (destabilizes alternative conformations)</p></li>
<li><p>Changes the relative heights of barriers between states</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This shifts the protein’s exploration of conformational space without creating entirely new structures.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spatial-relationships-matter-but-not-simply"><strong>Spatial Relationships Matter, But Not Simply</strong></h2>
<p><strong>“Upstream” implies linear directionality</strong>, but allosteric effects can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reciprocal</strong>: The active site’s state can also influence the allosteric site. It’s bidirectional coupling, not unidirectional causation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Distance-independent in surprising ways</strong>: Sometimes allosteric sites are far from the active site (classic allostery), but sometimes they’re quite close—just positioned so that binding causes a localized distortion that propagates. Conversely, distant sites might have weak effects if they’re not mechanically coupled through the protein’s architecture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pathway-dependent</strong>: The conformational change might propagate through specific structural elements (alpha helices, beta sheets, loop regions) that act as “wires” transmitting strain. Different allosteric sites might use different pathways to influence the same active site.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hemoglobin</strong> (classic example):</p>

<li><p>Four subunits arranged symmetrically</p></li>
<li><p>Oxygen binding to one subunit makes it easier for others to bind</p></li>
<li><p>Not “upstream/downstream” but rather <strong>cooperative coupling</strong>—binding at one site physically strains the interfaces between subunits, making the others more receptive</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kinases</strong> (signaling enzymes):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Often have activation loops that block the active site</p></li>
<li><p>Phosphorylation at an allosteric site causes the loop to swing away</p></li>
<li><p>This is mechanical: the added negative charge creates electrostatic repulsion that destabilizes the “closed” conformation</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>G-protein coupled receptors</strong> (GPCRs):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have distinct “inactive” and “active” conformations</p></li>
<li><p>Agonist binding at one site stabilizes the active state</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implications-for-drug-design"><strong>Implications for Drug Design</strong></h2>
<p>Understanding allostery as energetic/mechanical coupling rather than simple causal hierarchy matters because:</p>
<p><strong>You can target multiple states</strong>: If you understand the conformational ensemble, you can design drugs that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stabilize inactive conformations (inverse agonists)</p></li>
<li><p>Stabilize active conformations (agonists)</p></li>
<li><p>Lock the protein in intermediate states</p></li>
<li><p>Prevent conformational transitions altogether</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You can predict effects more accurately</strong>: AlphaFold and molecular dynamics simulations can now model:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How binding at one site changes the energy landscape</p></li>
<li><p>Which pathways transmit conformational changes</p></li>
<li><p>Whether an allosteric effect will be activating or inhibiting</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You can find better drug sites</strong>: Allosteric sites often have advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Less conserved across protein families (more selective)</p></li>
<li><p>Less critical for function (mutations less likely to cause resistance)</p></li>
<li><p>Can fine-tune activity rather than completely blocking it</p></li>

<section id="so-whats-the-right-mental-model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-whats-the-right-mental-model"><strong>So, What’s the Right Mental Model?</strong></h2>
<p>I’d suggest thinking of allosteric regulation as <strong>mechanical-energetic coupling within a dynamic conformational ensemble</strong> rather than upstream/downstream causation. The protein is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A flexible structure exploring conformational space</p></li>
<li><p>Mechanically coupled across its domains</p></li>
<li><p>Constantly shifting between related shapes</p></li>
<li><p>Stabilized in particular conformations by ligands that change the energy landscape</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The allosteric site doesn’t “control” the active site in a hierarchical sense—rather, they’re parts of an interconnected system where perturbations in one region necessarily affect the stability and dynamics of other regions.</p>
<p>This model better captures the reciprocal nature, the role of protein dynamics, and why drugs targeting allosteric sites can have such diverse effects (activation, inhibition, modulation) depending on exactly how they reshape the conformational landscape.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cryo-EM structures showing molecular machines in exquisite detail</p></li>
<li><p>AlphaFold’s entire protein structure database</p></li>

<p>These aren’t artist’s conceptions—they’re data-driven reconstructions showing actual structure and dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Functional complexity</strong>: The micro reveals not just structure but <strong>purposeful intricacy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ribosomes as molecular 3D printers</p></li>
<li><p>ATP synthase as a rotary motor</p></li>

<p>This isn’t random complexity—it’s <strong>engineered</strong> complexity (by evolution, but the effect on our intuitions is similar). We recognize problem-solving, information processing, error correction. It feels designed, intentional, purposeful.</p>

<p>Several factors suggest microscopic wonder is gaining ground:</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong>: You can explore protein structures on your laptop. You can’t meaningfully explore distant galaxies. The democratization of molecular visualization tools makes this accessible to billions of people in ways cosmology cannot match.</p>
<p><strong>Actionability</strong>: Understanding proteins leads to tangible outcomes—medicines, treatments, biotechnology. This creates a positive feedback loop: interest → understanding → application → renewed interest. Cosmology, for all its grandeur, rarely affects daily life.</p>
<p><strong>Educational emphasis</strong>: Biology education increasingly focuses on molecular mechanisms. Children grow up seeing animations of molecular machines. This cultivates intuitions about the micro that previous generations lacked.</p>
<p><strong>Technological mediation</strong>: We’re getting better at making the molecular world <em>feel real</em>:</p>

<p><strong>The complexity gradient</strong>: We may be reaching the limits of cosmic surprise. We’ve mapped the observable universe’s large-scale structure. Discoveries continue, but the basic picture is established.</p>
<p>By contrast, molecular biology feels <strong>pre-paradigmatic</strong> in comparison—we’re still discovering fundamental organizing principles. The complexity seems bottomless. Every protein structure reveals new ingenuity. Every pathway connects to others in unexpected ways.</p>

<li><p>Detailed mechanism</p></li>
<li><p>Functional elegance</p></li>
<li><p>Complexity serving purpose</p></li>
<li><p>Practical understanding</p></li>
<li><p>The intricate and intelligible</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But I’d wager that as molecular visualization improves, as education emphasizes these scales, and as biotechnology makes molecular understanding increasingly relevant, <strong>more people will find their deepest scientific awe in the micro rather than the macro</strong>.</p>
<p>The Powers of Ten journey is bidirectional, but we may discover that the inward journey—from human scale down to atoms—is ultimately richer in wonder than the outward journey to galaxies. Not because the cosmic is less magnificent, but because the molecular is both magnificent <em>and</em> meaningful in ways the cosmic cannot be.</p>
<p>We are, after all, not made of galaxies. We are made of proteins. And that may be the more profound truth.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>There was a computer ‘game’, released way back in 1992, that wasn’t really a game at all, but a <strong>social poison simulator</strong>. The game was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB_(video_game)">KGB</a>, and published by an appositely named company called Cryo.<sup>1</sup></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="when-computer-games-were-learning-about-themselves">When Computer Games were learning about themselves</h2>
<p>You see, back in the early 1990s, computer games, as a neophyte artform, were still trying to find out their grammar, best practice, standards and conventions that a history of experimentation already shown to have ‘worked’. Back in the 8 bit era of the 1980s even the basic mechanical conventions for inputting into games were still up for negotation: it took many years, for example, for the WASD keys to become the standard for specifying up-left-down-right on a standard keyboard. The increased power of 16 bit computers in the 1990s created a new set of dilemmas, conventions still to work out, simply because 16 bit computers were capable of doing many things that their 8 bit predecessors were not: they could <em>create and maintain complex simulations</em>, simplified, rule-bound, abstracted worlds, in which the player was foisted.</p>

<section id="games-just-one-component-of-games" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="games-just-one-component-of-games">Games: just one component of games</h2>
<p>Not all simulations are games, but the majority of games have elements of both theatricality and simulation. Theatricality includes everything from more-than-rudimentary graphics, through to sound design and story-telling. A game of sudoko could be rendered theatrical by, for example, telling a story about how solving the number sequence will unlock an antidote to a deadly poison. And like with pulp fiction, the same underlying game mechanics can be rendered sci-fi, fantasy or Western depending on the graphical stage dressing applied to the avatar and its obstacles.</p>

<section id="simulation-in-games" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simulation-in-games">Simulation in games</h2>
<p>Simulation emerges when there exist non-player agents in the game world whose behaviours are rule-bound in more than extremely simple ways. For example, a predator might exist in the game whose reaction to the player may depend on its level of hunger, and its level of hunger might itself depend on its interactions with other prey non-player agents whose behaviours are themselves rule-bound and determined by various competing motivations. As another example, a humanoid character may behave differently towards the player depending on the player’s behaviour towards other humanoid characters that the index character possesses either amity or emnity towards, or depending on the class of character the player elected as their avatar. Put simply, it is relatively simple, at least in theory, to simulate predator-prey dynamics, tribalism, and racism.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-fun-zone" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-fun-zone">The Fun Zone</h2>
<p>So to what extent is a good computer game one that is theatrically dressed, and exists in a rich simulation? Well, define ‘good’, and the kinds of feelings and experience one wishes to evoke in the player. Much of the grammar of modern games - the grammar established through experimentation and practice over the last three decades - seems to focus on helping players get quickly to what I’ve heard called the Fun Zone, and then keeping them there. Aside from the theatrics, the Fun Zone seems largely indistinguishable from the concept of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Flow State</a>: a state of being in which both one’s perception of time becomes much compressed, and one’s perception of self becomes greatly attenuated. A Flow State classically occurs when an individual is engaged in an activity that exists <em>at or marginally beyond</em> their current abilities. A Flow State occurs when an individual has submitted themselves to a form of activity that demands their full attention, giving little or no opportunity for the kind of conscious self-reflection and rumination that defines the state of existing in the Default Mode Network. The Flow State is when Human Being becomes Human Doing, and through this achieves a kind of sublime integration of self. Games are, at their best, the canonical learning experience, and learning is, at its best, the ultimate form of game.</p>
</section>
<section id="simulation-and-the-fun-zone" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simulation-and-the-fun-zone">Simulation and the Fun Zone</h2>
<p>Given this, how does simulation help help gamers enter and remain in the Fun Zone? Of course, it depends. Some aspects of simulation can help with entering and remaining in this state; whereas other can make entry harder and the Zone itself more slippery. Let’s try to think of some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simulation makes enemies and other characters more complex</strong>: This could harm entry/accessibility, but increase the challenge and reward, and so longevity of the Fun Zone experience, for those who manage to cross the initially higher barrier.</li>
<li><strong>Simulation makes the rules of the game more complex</strong>: If these simulation dynamics are introduced only incrementally, rather than all at once, then moderate-to-high simulation-based complexity can be absorbed successfully by the player, and lead to a gaming experience that has many more permutations of challenge to attempt to master, so increasing the longevity of the Fun Zone.</li>
<li><strong>Simulation brings the ecology of the game to the foreground, and therefore diminishes the impact of the player’s actions</strong>: Sometimes this can work, though more for games that preference low intensity longevity over high intensity brief bursts of full focus.</li>
<li><strong>Simulation adds elements that break or obscure the links between player action and consequence</strong>: Here simulation will tend to diminish the player experience, as it makes it harder to know how the player enters and remains on the Fun Zone.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="kgb-as-a-social-standing-simulator" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kgb-as-a-social-standing-simulator">KGB as a Social Standing Simulator</h2>
<p>It’s in relation to this last point of possible interaction between simulation and challenge-based Fun Zone maintenance that the key distinct feature of KGB comes to the fore. See, in KGB, you play an investigator in a crumbling Soviet Union, where everyone has learned never to say quite what they think, what they want, and what they intend to do. As an investigator, you will speak with dozens of other characters. As that’s your job. Every conversation affects how others see you, and how others see you has consequences for you and other. But as the characters you are speaking to tend to conceal their true motives and beliefs, the consequences of your conversations may not reveal themselves for some time.</p>
</section>
<section id="games-as-decision-feedback-mechanisms" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="games-as-decision-feedback-mechanisms">Games as Decision-Feedback Mechanisms</h2>
<p>To understand the implications of building these kinds of social dynamics into a game, let’s start with the following:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://jonminton.github.io/jon-blog/posts/unpop/remembering-kgb-social-poison-simulator/options-and-simple-quick-feedback.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Decisions and Feedback</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Here the player (left) has four distinct options: A, B, C and D. If they pick options A, C or D, <em>something bad</em> happens, and happens as a clear consequence of the player’s action. For example, if a player doesn’t jump over a barrier, they can’t move past the barrier. But if the player picks option B, <em>something good</em> happens: progress to a new area, an upgrade, a nicely reassuring sound and animation, etc. The link between the player’s <em>action</em> and the game’s <em>reaction</em> is short and and direct enough that the player quickly comes to recognise the reactions as feedback. And it’s this clear, direct feedback loop that provides the player with a sense of agency and engagement with the dynamics of the game.</p>
<p>A series of challenges, with right and wrong answers, can be the core of what makes a game an engaging experience, if served up in the right way. An obvious example of this type of game is a quiz, where by convention points conditionally accumulate depending on how many correct options were selected by the player. Many computer games implicitly involve something slightly more like a tournament of short quizzes, where progress to the next round depends on selecting all or most of the right answers to the current round.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="choice-but-not-too-much-choice-avoiding-the-curse-of-dimensionality">Choice, but not too much choice: Avoiding the Curse of Dimensionality</h2>
<p>This ‘quiz tournament’ structure to many computer games seems common for two reasons: firstly, it forces players to encounter, and master, different requisite skills in order of importance to the gameplay. If one gameplay mechanic depends on having understood another mechanic - rolling depending on walking; double-jumping depending on jumping, and so on - then this skills tournament structure ensures players should only be expected to solve problems they should already be just-about able to handle. The second reason relates to the ‘curse of dimensionality’, i.e.&nbsp;the way that if apparent choice really is an equally valid option, and if a game really were to keep track and respond to each of the choices made by the player, then the number of possible permutations of player action to react quickly explodes to an unmanageable level:</p>

<section id="games-as-funny-shaped-corridor-simulators" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="games-as-funny-shaped-corridor-simulators">Games as Funny-Shaped Corridor Simulators</h2>
<p>It’s for this kind of reason that, since the late 1990s at least, many of the worlds in which games are set tend to be much more limited and constrained than they first appear. Imagine the following: you’re walking in a corridor. There’s a door to the left; and a suspiciously large air-vent to the right.</p>
<ul>
<li>You keep going forward in the corridor: Your path is blocked by a giant boulder.</li>
<li>You take the door to the left: It’s just a cupboard.</li>
<li>You interact with the air-vent, and it opens. You can walk through this vent, and get to the next section.</li>
</ul>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Funny Shaped Topography</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This particular dynamic, which I think was largely pioneered by Half-Life in the late 1990s, has led to a genre I personally call <em>funny-shaped corridor simulators</em>.<sup>2</sup></p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://jonminton.github.io/jon-blog/posts/unpop/remembering-kgb-social-poison-simulator/funny-shaped-topology.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Funny Shaped Topology</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This their introduction in the late 1990s, funny-shaped-corridor games have been subject only to one further refinement: some of the ‘wrong paths’ in fact contain special prizes and ‘Easter eggs’, encouraging slightly more exploration and replay:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://jonminton.github.io/jon-blog/posts/unpop/remembering-kgb-social-poison-simulator/funny-shaped-with-prizes.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Funny Shaped Corridors (With Prizes!)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>So, clearly, the development of funny-shaped corridors in computer games has now become part of the standard grammar of modern games. A convention for giving players the illusion of choice about where to go, without having to deal with the explosive unpredictability that would come about if they really did have such choice.</p>

<section id="social-poisoning-as-cruelly-delayed-feedback" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="social-poisoning-as-cruelly-delayed-feedback">Social Poisoning as (Cruelly) Delayed Feedback</h2>
<p>What then does the social poisoning of KGB look like as a game dynamic, and why, perhaps, did it not become a part of the conventional game toolbox?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://jonminton.github.io/jon-blog/posts/unpop/remembering-kgb-social-poison-simulator/social-poisoning.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Social Poisoning - Bad choice, but I don’t know it</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>To simplify greatly, in most games there are:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol type="A">
<li>Correct choices, that are presented as correct choices</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" type="A">
<li>Incorrect choices, that are presented as incorrect choices</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>But in KGB, there were:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol type="A">
<li>Correct choices, that look like correct choices;</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" type="A">
<li>Incorrect choices, that look like incorrect choices;</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" type="A">
<li>Incorrect choices, that look like correct choices</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>In the figure, an example of A is the green path, which takes the player successfully from the start to the end of the game: the investigator solves the mystery, and not to too detrimental a cost to their health and/or sanity. And an example of B is the short path to the X, ‘A clear dead end’. The player says or does something, and the game tells them it was the wrong choice.</p>
<p>But <em>social poisoning</em>, path type C, is what’s represented by the orange series of paths. Initially, the choice appears to be positively rewarded: other options at the juncture all lead clearly to dead ends, whereas the option selected still brings up other options. The player <em>thinks</em> they are winning, whereas instead they are <em>just losing exceptionally slowly</em>. Each choice the player makes, conditional on having started out along the poison path, is just wasting more of their time, further elasticating the feedback loop connecting player action and consequence. The feedback loop is a <em>noose</em>, and with each further choice, each apparent step towards progress and reward, when on the poison path this noose tightens ever so slightly further.</p>
<p>So when, after having invested many hours in the game, apparently solved the mystery and navigated the hoodlums and apparatchiks and other threats, the player is then told their character upset a senior Kremlin member in disguise in the first few minutes, by expressing a personal preference for their erstwhile rival, and was from that conversation onwards marked for death… the player may well declare, <em>this game isn’t fair!</em>. (And worse: <em>this game isn’t fun!</em>)</p>
</section>
<section id="concealed-endings-a-slight-return" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="concealed-endings-a-slight-return">Concealed Endings: A Slight Return</h2>
<p>Although games that depend as cryptically on apparently innocuous early game choices are not common, there are many games where - throughout - the player is given a clear choice between a ‘low road’, combining short-term expedience with longer-term costs, and a ‘high road’, with the opposite, and served up a ‘better ending’ if they keep choosing high road options and a ‘worse ending’ if they keep choosing low road options. In almost all such cases, however, implications of such choices are not concealed, and the vast majority of the game experience is identical regardless of whether the player elects to be more of a ‘scoundral’ or a ‘savior’. Such choices are mostly illusory and aesthetic in their implications: you travel the concealed corridor in either case, just the door at the end will be painted blue or red depending on the earlier ‘decisions’.</p>
<p>There is only one modern game I’m aware of that goes some way towards concealing important decisions of this form. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro:_Last_Light">this game</a> the player is fighting - in a very linear fashion - for the salvation of the human race. But it is through many apparently innocuous decisions that the player can ‘decide’ whether the human race is itself worth saving. One example of this: the protagonist has a guitar in their bunk, and this guitar can be interacted with. If the player chooses to arrest their bloodlust briefly, and stop to play this guitar, to value music and play over warfare and following orders, unbeknownst to their player their ‘karma score’ is increased, and with this their probability of seeing the ‘good ending’.</p>
</section>
<section id="games-as-escapism-the-real-reason-social-poison-simulators-arent-popular" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="games-as-escapism-the-real-reason-social-poison-simulators-arent-popular">Games as Escapism: The Real Reason Social Poison Simulators aren’t popular</h2>
<p>So, KGB - <a href="https://classicreload.com/play/dosx-kgb.html#">which can now be played online</a> - represents an intriguing failed experiment in games mechanics. An interesting curio that, for various reasons, failed to become part of the standard grammar of modern games.</p>
<p>In the above, I’ve aimed to use KGB as a slight aberation from the conventions of modern games in order to bring these conventions and standards to light, along with some explanations for why they became so. In particular, in terms of the role that aspects of simulation and games mechanics have to delivering the Fun Zone to players, we can say that long and concealed decision implications of the sort embedded in KGB meant that the conventional learning and feedback loop at the heart of most engaging games was missing in places, even though (given some choices can cause the protagonist to lose immediately) most of the time the action-consequence loop was conventionally short.</p>
<p>But of course there’s one explanation, for why Social Poison Simulators didn’t take off as games, that should be uncontroversial to both many critics and some supporters of computer games alike: <em>part of the appeal of games is that they offer a form of escapism</em>. And one of the things that many people seek respite from is exactly the kind of complex social judgement, the meta-thinking, the higher-order guessing games, the lack of ever quite knowing where one stands amongst peers, of not knowing what one does not know, and of sensing but not quite being able to confirm that one’s fate has been decided silently by others, that KGB’s social poison mechanics were, in a highly simplified and stylised form, alluding to and evoking.</p>
<p>Put simply: social poison simulators are rare in computer games <em>because</em> they’re common in the real life games of social relationships. The concept of social poison is perhaps <em>too real</em>, no matter how crudely it’s implemented in game form. Perhaps the most important reason social poisoning never took off in computer games is because it reminds people that, in the one game they cannot elect not to play, the game they can only play once, they might have already lost without ever realising it.</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>Note from Claude: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB_(video_game)">KGB</a> was released in 1992 for Amiga and IBM PC compatibles. It was developed by Cryo Interactive Entertainment and published by Virgin Games (not Cryo themselves, though the confusion is understandable given the developer’s name). The game was later re-released on CD as “Conspiracy” featuring clips with Donald Sutherland. Set during the final days of the Soviet Union, it’s a point-and-click adventure where players investigate corruption as a KGB officer. It was a terrifying, fascinating, possibly unique ‘game’, the likes of which I don’t think we’ll ever see again.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Note from Claude: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)">Half-Life</a> was released on November 19, 1998, and indeed pioneered several innovations in level design that the author describes. Valve created a large interconnected world where loading happened seamlessly behind the scenes, with players navigating the Black Mesa research facility through both linear progression and hub areas requiring backtracking. This approach—combining the illusion of open exploration with carefully controlled linear progression—contrasted sharply with the disconnected arena-based levels typical of earlier FPS games. The game’s use of scripted sequences that maintained player control rather than cutscenes further enhanced the sense of exploring a continuous, immersive world rather than discrete gaming levels. Why? Because for all of the curviness and excentricity of some of the concealed dead ends, <em>topologically</em> such game environments are just big corridors!↩︎</p></li>

  <title>Three quality-of-life upgrades</title>
  <dc:creator>Jon Minton</dc:creator>
  <link>https://jonminton.github.io/jon-blog/posts/three-qol-updates/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Here’s a brief update to showcase three new improvements to this blog, along with a question (about RSSes), and some broader reflections:</p>
<section id="rss-feed" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rss-feed">RSS Feed</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.danolner.net/">Dan Olner</a>, who’s been blogging longer than me, and usually with more interesting contents, made a request on Linkedin to enable RSS on the blog. Thankfully he supplied <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#rss-feed">the relevant link too</a>, and it all seems quite straightforward. If you now look towards the top right of the blog, you should be able to see the standard RSS icon, and clicking on it does seem to do <em>something</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reflection</strong>: This blog largely began with two aims: to have a practical application for practicing web development skills, and to have a place to develop and showcase my knowledge of statistical methods and data science. I think it’s been successful on both fronts, but it’s also become my platform for trying to think deeply about less technical and work-related domains, such as with my unpop series, and more recently the first short story I’ve finished writing for a number of years. Though writing is a practice I find purposive and enjoyable, and my writing is on topics and ideas that are interesting to me, they might not be of as much interest to persons reading just for the more technical materials.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: There are ways of creating multiple RSS feeds - such as one for more technical posts, and another for less technical posts. <strong>Should I create separate RSS feeds for this blog?</strong> Any views on this are much appreciated.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="word-count" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="word-count">Word Count</h2>
<p>The subheader to the main blog page should now be procedurally updated to report the number of words the blog contains. At the time of writing the total estimated word count is slightly under 180,000 words, which if at all accurate means, since starting the blog in 2023, I’ve now put out around two books worth of content into the world.</p>
<p>Here’s broadly how the word count works:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>_quarto.yml</code> file in the root now has a pre-render argument, meaning each time the blog is rendered or published an R script is run.</li>
<li>The R script recursively searches for all .qmd (quarto) files inside the project folder and its subfolders. Within each .qmd file it looks for anything that looks to be a word (i.e.&nbsp;something made up of letters and numbers, surrounded by spaces or punctuation) and adds that to a running total, until all has run out of .qmd files.</li>
<li>The R script then looks for the subtitle field in index.qmd, then inserts the new word count into the value component of that field.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with so much knowledge work, this solution was arrived at after asking a series of questions to an LLM. This time I tried Claude as I’d heard it was better at technical queries than most alternatives (though Claude are not Claude is: there are many versions). The solution I used was more inspired by, rather than derived directly from, any specific pieces of code it suggested. The subtle danger of using LLMs is that, though they promise to make coding tasks easier, they often instead just transfer the challenges from searching and writing code, to prompting and debugging code. Almost every code solution offered had bugs, and almost every suggested fix introduced new bugs. Knowing when to step away from just plugging in a new AI-generated code, and instead writing something loosely based on the code snippets, seems to be at least half the battle in using AI effectively.</p>
</section>
<section id="repeated-measures-header-image" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="repeated-measures-header-image">Repeated Measures Header Image</h2>
<p>My <a href="../../posts/handdrawn-stats/repeated-measures/index.html">article on repeated measures</a> is the first post I’ve written that’s entirely hand-written, and hand-drawn, using my <a href="https://remarkable.com/">Remarkable</a> tablet. This meant the post comprised one single image. And in Quarto blogs the first image in a post is used, along with the title and first paragraph, to show previews of that post in the main blog page. This in effect meant the entire repeated measures post was used as its own preview, creating one very long and awkward side image for the post in the main blog page view.</p>
<p>I’ve now corrected this by adding a smaller image, copied out from the main image, at the start of the repeated measures post. This should hopefully ensure the preview for the post is a bit less ‘greedy’, and can be more easily scrolled through with other blog entries in the main blog page.</p>
<p>I’m still trying to come up with the best way of using Remarkable. For <a href="../../posts/fiction/its-your-choice/index.html">my short story</a>, for example, the entire story was first drafted with the device, then transcribed (manually, not automatically, as I don’t trust the image-to-text conversion enough, especially for conveying formatting) onto a Quarto page. For the repeated measures blog, where I frequently swap between text and sketches, I think the Remarkable was fully appropriate. For the story, it was still useful because it meant I could take the tablet alone, without my computer, forcing myself to have fewer distractions while writing it.</p>
<p>For the most recent post - my <a href="../unpop/the-what-is-a-genius-myth/9781787333246-jacket-large.webp">book review of The Genius Myth</a> - I instead adopted more of a hybrid approach from the get-go, writing most of the text in Quarto, then having the Remarkable by my side for drawing sketches to go alongside the text. As the Remarkable syncs quite nicely and quickly with my macbook, this hybrid approach seemed to work pretty well, though it did involve taking more, rather than less, electronic equipment with me.</p>

<section id="revisionism-and-reactionism" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="revisionism-and-reactionism">Revisionism and Reactionism</h2>
<p>There was a phase, a few years ago, when revisionist social science non-fiction by British science authors (often affiliated with the BBC) was in vogue. By revisionist I mean something like <em>works intending to challenge problematic assumptions commonly made in certain social scientific and affiliated disciplines, assumptions considered potentially dangerous and socially regressive in their implications and popular interpretations</em>. Often such assumptions related to sex and gender, sometimes to race, sometimes to sexuality, or more occasionally to cultural superiority.</p>
<p>Some examples: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_(book)"><strong>Inferior</strong></a> (about gender differences) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior:_The_Return_of_Race_Science"><strong>Superior</strong></a> (about race differences) by Angela Saini; a tranche of books about testosterone and sex differences by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordelia_Fine">Cordelia Fine</a>; certain books by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Rutherford">Adam Rutherford</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Women:_Exposing_Data_Bias_in_a_World_Designed_for_Men"><strong>Invisible Women</strong></a> by Caroline Criado Perez: mostly books I’ve read (or tried to).</p>
<p>The problem with such books: <em>revisionism is to the political left as reactionism is to the political right</em>. The impulse is the same: to be contrary, sometimes just for the sake of it. The strength of such books is they <em>can</em> help to help us see the waters in which specific disciplines swim; the limitations are then either that they may argue for the fields to be dredged; or that they are in practice simply incurious about the the disciplines they seek to critique, seeing them just as another field to fight the progressive fight.</p>
<p>Sometimes the urge towards resistance and contrarianism - whether to fight the progressive fight as in revisionism, or fight the conservative fight as in reactionism - can lead to strange bedfellows and outright contradiction. A key example of this: on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m00055m9">Monday 20 May 2019 Radio 4’s <em>Start the Week</em></a> featured Angela Saini, and Caroline Criado Perez. Saini’s previous book, <strong>Inferior</strong>, essentially argued that many sciences overstate sex differences, leading to sexism and other forms of harm against women. Perez’s book, <strong>Invisible Women</strong>, by contrast argues that many sciences <em>understate</em> sex differences, and assume that research conducted in men also generalises simply to women, <em>also</em> constituting a form of sexism and harm against women. So, identifying and highlighting sex differences is sexist; and not identifying and not highlighting sex differences is also sexist.<sup>1</sup></p>

<section id="the-genius-myth-conceit" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-genius-myth-conceit">The Genius Myth Conceit</h2>
<p>All of which is intended to be a preamble to my notes on Helen Lewis’ book <strong>The Genius Myth</strong>. Many years ago Lewis could easily be grouped with the likes of Saini, Fine, and Perez, as someone perhaps more motivated to argue against a perceived (and perceived-to-be-harmful) scientific orthodoxy, than to present a coherent scientific synthesis on particular topics and fields, the kind of synthesis - the capacity to abstract, generalise, explain and understand, efficiently and effectively - that, for me, allows popular science to, at its best, induce a near psychedelic sense of <em>awe</em> in the reader.<sup>2</sup> Fortunately, Lewis’ <strong>The Genius Myth</strong> has two things going for it that make it a much more interesting book than some of the above: 1) Lewis has to an extent been ‘mugged by reality’ when it comes to failing certain ideological purity tests (mostly due to holding views considered by some to be ‘gender critical’, and by others just as ‘common sense’); 2) Lewis is genuinely curious and an effective, engaging writer.</p>
<p>The <em>conceit</em> of <strong>The Genius Myth</strong> is definitely <em>revisionist</em>. It’s something like:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>the idea of labelling some people as ‘geniuses’ is right-wing, because it focuses on the myth of inherent superiority, and downplays the sociological and environmental factors that enabled such individuals to flourish. It also gives such individuals too much of a ‘free pass’ in tolerating, even condoning, bad behaviour that would not be acceptable in non-geniuses. So it promotes something like a two-tier ethics: one rule for them, another for everyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, both the advantage and limitation of <strong>The Genius Myth</strong> is in its chatty wooliness, its (and Lewis’) convivial curiosity. Despite being anchored around the conceit of deconstructing a dangerous dogma, <strong>The Genius Myth</strong> takes a scenic route through to its (uncertain) destination, stopping frequently to smell the roses (and all too often the malodorous manure in which it’s grown).</p>
<p>Now to the subtitle of my review: <em>term undefined</em>. Lewis adopts, at best, a pornography censor’s approach to defining genius: <em>you know it when you see it</em>. Or at least she seems to for the first part of the book, which focuses on criticising various efforts to identify geniuses, support geniuses, and (as part of the right-edge of the eugenics movement) to help breed more geniuses.</p>
</section>
<section id="searching-for-genius-a-right-wing-enterprise" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="searching-for-genius-a-right-wing-enterprise">Searching for Genius: A Right-wing enterprise?</h2>
<p>Starting with the claim that “Genius is a right-wing concept, because it champions the individual over the collective”, part one focuses on endeavours by the likes of Francis Galton and Lewis Terman to, respectively, profile proven geniuses and identify potential geniuses. The former endeavour suffered from a kind of survivorship bias: of course in iniquitous times only those whose hereditary bequests are financial as well as cognitive, people independently wealthy have well connected, have the kind of environment in which such talents are liable to flourish, and for their potential to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>So, over the early 20th century attempts to measure cognitive ability in everyone, not just laud its presence in the landed gentry, gained momentum, and the science and concept of IQ was born. Lewis Terman attempted to use this nascent discipline to identify, at a young age, those children most likely to become exceptionally smart adults, and support them in actualising their potential. How smart? ‘Genius level’, of course. Casting the net of cognitive testing wide, Terman’s cognitive child elites were dubbed his ‘Termites’.</p>
<p>Lewis argues that such efforts - to pick ‘winners’ early using cognitive testing - were largely unsuccessful. How? By pointing out a number of occasions where individuals, who were judged ‘smart but not smart enough’ and rejected (miscategorised?) by Terman in his attempts to find budding geniuses, then turned out to be extremely capable scientists and engineers, clearly ‘geniuses’ (again using the porn censor’s definition) in retrospect. The median achievements of the Termites, however, were much more modest.</p>
<p>Later, and entertainingly, Lewis discusses the highly dysfunctional and fractious nature of high IQ societies, more bastions for obsessive weirdos and conspiracy theorists with limited practical skills and big chips on their shoulders, than for high functioning geniuses.</p>
<p>Many of the examples in this part were interesting to me, and many of the arguments broadly convincing. Part of me wishes Lewis had delved a little more into the technical minutae of the concept of ‘g’ in cognitive testing, and of its measurement in children, as such issues could explain much of what she discusses in this part. (A more realistic part of me is glad she didn’t, as I don’t think these aspects would be her forte…)</p>
</section>
<section id="iq-and-g" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="iq-and-g">IQ and g</h2>
<p>Regarding IQ and <strong>g</strong>. We have, fundamentally, a proposition: how good someone is at answering one question testing general reasoning ability should be broadly predictive of how they answer others. The tendency to answer each question correctly is partly determined by something underlying and inherent, a single ‘latent factor’, commonly called <strong>g</strong>; conversely, the average tendency (maybe weighted by difficulty) to answer a batch of questions correctly should be a reasonable way of assessing what this <strong>g</strong> is for an individual. IQ scores are therefore broadly numeric descriptions of what an individual’s estimated <strong>g</strong> value, as normed against the general population: 100 for the average score, 115 (usually) for about one standard deviation above the average (higher than about two thirds of the population), 130 for two standard deviations above (higher than about 19 people out of 20), and so on. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule">here</a> for the statistical heuristics; and <a href="../../../posts/handdrawn-stats/how-factor-analysis-is-used-in-testing/index.html">this earlier statistical post</a> for more on the theory of psychometric testing.)</p>
<p>However, though psychometric models can be run which jump straight to this ‘one underlying factor model’ (the ‘big <strong>g</strong>’), this doesn’t seem to be how most modern IQ test batteries are designed. Rather, it’s recognised that there are a number of distinct subdimensions - sub-batteries of test items that are more internally coherent to each other than to other items - that the battery of items group into. One subdivision is between ‘crystallised’ and ‘fluid’ intelligence; another subdivision may be between ‘verbal’ and ‘numeric’ intelligence. Such subdivisions just tend to drop out of patterns of correlation between collections of items. The sub-factors tend to be positively correlated; but items testing (say) crystallised intelligence tend to be more correlated with each other than (say) items testing fluid intelligence.</p>
</section>
<section id="iq-vs-achieved-genius" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="iq-vs-achieved-genius">IQ vs Achieved Genius</h2>
<p>What implications do these subfactors have on what we might call ‘achieved genius’? Well, an IQ test is something of a grab-bag of evaluations, and to the extent it’s at all predictive of job performance, what it tends to return is an average of expected performant abilities across a variety of jobs and roles. It’s a <em>generic score</em> for a <em>generic job</em> requiring some level of cognitive ability.</p>
<p>But <em>no one has a generic job</em>, i.e.&nbsp;a job whose performance depends equally<sup>3</sup> on all those subfactors tested somewhere within most IQ tests. IQ tests are, at best, attempts at predicting the ability of someone in a fictitious job that doesn’t exist. (Though a fictitious job also potentially closer to most jobs than any specific job selected at random.)</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;All too often <em>realised genius</em> (if we are to use that term) is a function of how well one’s specific cognitive profile <em>matches</em> with the demands of the role someone is actually expected to perform. Someone might have great ability with spatial reasoning, say, but if the demands of their role are largely about verbal acuity, then that high <em>potential</em> ability in their strongest subdomain won’t translate into real world achievements. Almost invariably, if an individual <em>can</em> find a role that works to their strengths, their actual performance will tend to be greater than that predicted by a generic <strong>g</strong> score implicitly based around the requirements of a generic job.</p>
<p>We’ll delve more into this in the critique of part two. But first let’s address the issue of how IQ tests are performed in children, as this relates to another piece of technical context for part one.</p>
</section>
<section id="iq-norms-in-infancy-and-childhood" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="iq-norms-in-infancy-and-childhood">IQ Norms in Infancy and Childhood</h2>
<p>Think of <a href="https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/resources/uk-who-growth-charts-0-4-years">an infant growth chart</a> used by pediatricians. The weight and height (initially length) of the infant is recorded at different times since birth. What’s the infant’s size and weight at birth, at 6 months, and two years, and so on? Such information, tracking an individual size and weight over time, can be plotted with age on the horizontal axis, and height/weight on the vertical. Typically, for hundreds or thousands of such infants, the height/weight trajectories of infants on their path to childhood have a tendency to increase quickly to start with, then perhaps to level off. There are also some types of trajectory, and age-based values of height/weight, that are more common, and others that are more uncommon.</p>
<p>From the assessment of a large population of infants over time, growth charts are developed, and child’s weight and height at a particular age since birth can be categorised both <em>relative to their younger and older selves</em> (a polyline through time), <em>and also</em> relative to a population of infants measured at exactly the same age. From this, the infant’s dimension can be expressed as being on <em>a percentile</em> given their age. And from this the pediatrician might, if they were feeling especially brave or incautious, wish to produce a predicted (or projected) height and weight of that infant if and when they reach adulthood. At its simplist, this would involve stating something like: <em>this infant was measured as on the 20th percentile of length at six weeks of age. If they were to remain at this same percentile throughout childhood then they would grow to 5’11” in height in adulthood.</em></p>
<p>So, why would this kind of extrapolation be incautious? Because we know there can be a great deal of variation between how <em>a specific infant</em> grows over time, and the statistical average. For example: one infant could start off on the 90th percentile at 6 weeks, then fall off to the 60th by six months; another could remain at the 30th percentile from birth to 12 years of age, then jump to the 70th percentile between their 13th and 14th birthday. In either case, relying on a single measure to extrapolate to adult height and weight seems pretty foolish.</p>
<p>But when it comes to identifying ‘geniuses’ in childhood, it does seem that something like this single-measure extrapolation issue is at play. Like size, performance in cognitive tests tends to vary with age across childhood. So like weight and length/height in infant growth charts, a given score could (say) place someone at the 20th percentile if measured at five years of age, but at the 55th percentile if measured at the six and a half years of age.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the (I think) largely justified questioning in the Genius Myth of whether the individual reported as having the highest recorded IQ, Marilyn vos Savant, really did so (and whether this high recorded score really means what we might intuitively assume it to mean). To quote the opening paragraph of the chapter:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Who has the highest IQ in history? One answer would be: a little girl from Missouri. In 1956, she took a version of the Stanford-Binet test and recorded a mental age of twenty-two years and ten months, equivalent to an IQ of 228. (The score needed to get into Mensa is 140, and the average IQ in the general population is 100.) Her score lay unnoticed for decades, until it was uncovered and sent in to the Guinness Book of World Records, which declared her to be the smartest person who ever lived. A genius, in other words. Her name, appropriately enough, was Marilyn vos Savant.<sup>4</sup></p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="fermi-and-the-million-planets" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fermi-and-the-million-planets">Fermi and the Million Planets</h2>
<p>A critical question about this little girl: <em>how</em> little? How young was Marilyn when this test was taken? As Lewis discusses, there’s some uncertainty in this answer, and this uncertainty could be crucial. Let’s walk through why, with a little Fermi estimation and my sketch below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assuming a standard deviation of 16<sup>5</sup> points, an IQ of 228 is 8 standard deviations above the average.</li>
<li>Now, with a Normal distribution, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(Z%20%5Cge%208)%20%5Capprox%2010%5E%7B-15%7D">.</li>
<li>World population back in 1956, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Capprox%2010%5E%7B9%7D"></li>
</ul>
<p>Put simply: the world population was orders of magnitude too small back in 1956 for it to have been likely to have found someone whose ‘true’ cognitive ability was 8 standard deviations above the mean. How many orders of magnitude? Well, 15 - 9 is 6, so we would likely require about a million Planet Earths, with 1950s/1960s population sizes, to find someone as apparently able as vos Savant. <sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Given this, artefactual explanations seem far more likely. Let’s look at the sketch:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://jonminton.github.io/jon-blog/posts/unpop/the-what-is-a-genius-myth/mvs.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">MVS age uncertainty</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In this sketch I’ve drawn out some cognitive growth curves showing how raw scores might get translated into age-normalised scores. The average score for a particular age is shown as a solid blue line, one standard deviation above and below as blue dashed lines, and 2 standard deviations as green dashed lines. We could imagine further isobars(?) like these, indicating, three, four, five, up to 8 standard deviations below and above the age-normed population average.</p>
<p>Something else I’ve drawn is a horizontal red line: this is the maximum raw score achievable given the test battery. If the test has 40 items, and someone gets every question correct, then the test is technically <em>censored</em> in its estimate of the person’s ability to complete such tests. Note a couple more things: firstly, how the same raw test score (a perfect score) maps onto <em>different percentiles</em> depending on the test-taker’s age. Secondly (and this is just the converse of the first point), how the very highest apparent percentile scores can only be achieved in earlier childhood. So, at age 5, the top raw score might place someone 8 standard deviations above the mean; at age 6, the same score might place them ‘only’ 6.4 SDs above the mean; and at 7, ‘only’ 5.7 SDs above, and so on. All the way up to adulthood, where the top score will ‘only’ indicate that someone’s 3.2 SDs above the population average.</p>
<p>Now imagine there’s also uncertainty about the test-taker’s age, especially in earlier childhood, where the gradient of percentiles is steepest. Let’s say Marilyn’s recorded age was as indicated with the letter <strong>M</strong>: <em>very</em> very very impressive for her age (and most ages). But if her actual age were a few weeks or months later, indicated by the symbol <strong>M?</strong>, this equal raw score would be ‘merely’ very very impressive for her age. This loss of a ‘very’ could conceivably be a couple of standard deviations, even more, if the error in age is especially egregious (and/or the accuracy with which the percentiles are estimated at younger ages is especially lower).</p>
</section>
<section id="a-quiet-return-from-galton" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-quiet-return-from-galton">A quiet return from Galton…</h2>
<p>Something else is also likely at play too, one of the oldest phenomena observed in statistical inference. See the figure below as an illustration. Here I’ve drawn just the Z scores (tramlines for percentiles) against age. I’ve sketched out three individuals who were tested multiple times, each at slightly different ages. Red has a first score that starts off high, then <em>falls down towards the average</em>; grey stays around the middle throughout, though oscillates quite a lot. Black starts off with an especially low score, but over time it <em>rises up towards the average</em>.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://jonminton.github.io/jon-blog/posts/unpop/the-what-is-a-genius-myth/reg.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Examples of regression to the mean in score percentiles against age for three hypothetical persons</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>What is this an example of? <em>Regression towards the mean</em>, originally referred to as <em>regression towards mediocrity</em> by none other than.. Francis Galton. Put simply: when something or someone is being tested repeatedly, more generically but abstractly whenever a population is being sampled from repeatedly, exceptional scores are likely to be followed by less exceptional scores, regardless of the direction of exceptionalness. Here red’s first score was exceptionally high, and black’s score exceptionally low, but both subjects tended towards less exceptional scores after more measures.</p>
<p>Now, as far as I can tell the “World’s Smartest Person” moniker for vos Savant was based on a single childhood test. Given it implies an IQ eight standard deviations above the mean, and we would likely require about a million planets to find someone this exceptional if artefacts aren’t at play, we can hopefully assume something like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>vos Savant was and remained better at completing these kinds of tests than most people at all ages</li>
<li>vos Savant was likely precocious in her cognitive development, literally much ahead of the growth curve for critical parts of childhood.</li>
<li>vos Savant’s age may well have been misestimated when ‘The Test’ was completed.</li>
<li>vos Savant likely had a good day on the day she was asked to complete the test.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="back-to-iq-and-job-performance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="back-to-iq-and-job-performance">Back to IQ and Job Performance</h2>
<p>Let’s now start to close another open loop from earlier: the idea that if IQ is positively predictive of job performance, it’s only in quite a generic sense, for quite a generic job. If ‘genius’ is about achievement in a specific career pathway (and the career is in something other than completing IQ tests), then why might we <em>not</em> expect the persons with the highest measured IQ scores to be most most likely to be ‘geniuses’ in any particular fields?</p>
<p>To think more about that question, let’s think a bit about role-playing games, and in particular standard practices for generating characters in such games.</p>
</section>
<section id="cognitive-traits-and-rpgs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cognitive-traits-and-rpgs">Cognitive Traits and RPGs</h2>
<p>Typically, an RPG that allows character design will have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A series of K (say ten) attributes, each with minimum and maximum possible scores.</li>
<li>A total ‘pool’ of M (say 150) attribute or skill points, which can be spent/allocated to each of the 10 attributes.</li>
</ul>
<p>One option a player could take would be to create a ‘balanced’ character. With 10 attributes and 150 points, for example, this would mean assigning 15 equally to each of the 10 attributes. This would be a Jack-of-all-Trades type character, with no obvious weaknesses, but no particular strengths either.</p>
<p>For many RPGs, however, a balanced character tends neither to be the most interesting nor strategically advantageous way to play. Instead, most such games involve forming a team (either composed of other real-life players, as in an online game, or computer-generated characters, as with a single person game). The challenge in forming a team then becomes <em>recruit and maintain working relationships with other persons whose attributes <strong>complement</strong> one’s own</em>. Within a team, the weaknesses or shortfalls in one character’s attributes are balanced out by another character’s strengths in these same attributes. (For example, someone with high strength but low wisdom being balanced out by another character with high wisdom but low strength: The brains, and the brawn.)</p>
</section>
<section id="teamwork-in-theory" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="teamwork-in-theory">Teamwork in Theory</h2>
<p>The effectiveness of the team at meeting the challenges it encounters, i.e.&nbsp;the effectiveness of the team, therefore depends on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The strategic decisions made by the team to direct itself to challenges that it is at least adequately prepared for;</li>
<li>The maximum potential ability that exists within the team to solve the specific challenges of the particular encounters it faces;</li>
<li>The tactical capacity of the team to turn to and support the specific team member best suited to the current challenge quickly and efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although many or most RPGs are set in fantasy worlds, the factors at play in ensuring a team works effectively are far from fantastical, and very much real life matters. I think there’s both something in this realisation that strongly supports the general thrust of Lewis’ arguments, as well as something that either challenges or caveats them.</p>
<p>In terms of supporting Lewis’ position: throughout the book there are many examples given of where the apparent, realised genius of an individual ‘genius’ turns out to be a much more collective endeavour than it might first appear, and even if the maximum team size that a ‘genius’ can effectively recruit and maintain throughout their lifetime is two people. In the chapter <strong>Great Wives</strong>, Lewis highlights the critical importance of Leo Tolstoy’s wife, Sofia, in managing the more mundane intellectual tasks - such as transcription and editing - which allowed his most (purportedly) well read novels to become works of genius. For those lacking the inclination or social aptitude to acquire a wife, a mother or even an institution (Cambridge university in Isaac Newton’s case, insane asylums or cloisters for others) can function similarly to remove those quotidian considerations otherwise required to feed the (often minimal) material necessities of those obsessed ‘loners’ whom history has come to consider ‘genius’. Such loners are seldom ever really alone, rather supported quietly by others, allowing them in which they can feed deeply on their own thoughts.</p>
<p>In the chapter following <strong>Great Wives</strong>, <strong>Keepers of the Flame</strong>, Lewis points out that the tenure of such complementary partnerships can even extend beyond the life of the index case, as with the widows of Jackson Pollock and Vincent Van Gogh. <sup>7</sup></p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Three possible cognitive profiles. Compared with the second profile, the third profile might be more likely to manifest both as ‘genius’ as well as learning disabled</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>There’s another aspect of this team-level focus on the creation of genius which, I think, either challenges or caveats aspects of Lewis’ arguments. This relates to the chapter <strong>The Deficit Model</strong>, whose opening quotation, by Aldous Huxley, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If we evolved a race of Isaac Newtons, that would not be progress. For the price Newton had to pay for being a supreme intellect was that he was incapable of friendship, love, fatherhood, and many other desirable things. As a man he was a failure; as a monster he was superb.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lewis later defines ‘the deficit model of genius’ as being the idea that “in exchange for the precious gift of genius, there is a human price to be paid.” Here I think there’s a <strong>strong version</strong> of the Deficit Model, which <em>is</em> likely a myth in every sense; and a <strong>weak version</strong> of the Deficit Model, which I think Lewis might be too easily discounting.</p>
<p>The <strong>strong version</strong> of the Deficit Model would be something like <em>the greater an individual’s failings in other domains, the greater their genius in their specialism</em>. An example of this would be arguing that Stephen Hawking’s achievements in cosmology in a sense emerged <em>because</em> of his Motor Neuron Disease, rather than <em>despite</em> his disability. Or that John Nash’s insights into game theory emerged <em>because</em> of his schizophrena, not <em>despite</em> it. As Lewis suggests (I assume correctly, but haven’t checked), Hawking’s research intensity fell after his MND became more severe, even though it was after this period when he reached broad public consciousness; and Nash’s work tended to be hindered, rather than enabled, by his more severe mental health crises. The strong version is clearly false, but mythical, because it implicitly posits something like Karmic justice afoot in an indifferent, cold, rule-bound universe: some kind of cosmic compensation being at play in cards people are dealt. Unlike a nice, fair fantasy game, some people really are given far more attribute points to spend on themselves than others, and so the game will tend to be easier for them than others granted less generous endowments.</p>
<p>But then there does seem to be a <strong>weak version</strong> of the Deficit Model which I think should be harder to discount. This comes about from both the strengths and the limitations that emerge when people might have had the good fortune to have been allocated a great many skill points, but also the mixed fortune to have had such points allocated in a very uneven way.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the RPG skill point example. A nice, balanced game would hold the skill points allotment - the pool of free skill points which can be allocated - constant, while allowing players high latitude in how such points can be allocated. And as already mentioned, the simplest way to allocate such skill points would be equally, the Jack-of-all-Trades strategy, leading to low (or no) <em>variance</em> between skill items.</p>
<p>Implicitly, something like an IQ score can be seen both as a measure of the <em>skill points allotment</em>, the <em>pool of free points,</em> as well as the assumption that such points <em>are</em> allocated in a Jack-of-all-Trades style way, with fairly low variance between specific cognitive traits. How do we know this? Because for most people, the between-traits variance <em>is</em> low. This shouldn’t be surprising, because the specific traits are often selected such that, within most of the population tested (i.e.&nbsp;most people) they are highly correlated, and have low variance.</p>
<p>And what happens when individuals’ profiles exhibit lower-than-expected correlation between traits, much higher variance? Well, quite often the implication is drawn that it’s the high-variance individuals, rather than the test assumptions, that are <em>wrong</em>. More specifically, high variance between cognitive traits - ‘hills and valleys’ rather than ‘plateaus’ - is often used as evidence with which to label such individuals as having <em>specific learning disabilities</em> (SLD) or <em>developmental disorders,</em> such as ADHD, dyslexia, and autism.</p>
<p>And therein lies the possible truth behind a <strong>weak version of the Deficit Model:</strong> having higher variance between cognitive traits, including performance in specific traits that are below the population average (not just below those that might be expected from a high-variance individual’s <strong>g</strong>), can be highly debilitating in a great many ways. In particular, by analogy with something like Endowment Theory,<sup>8</sup> we might assume that having a trait score (say) 10 points below the population average can be substantially more disadvantagous to an individual being able to perform trait-related activities than being 10 points above the population average would be advantageous for performing such activities. Put more simply: deficits often harm more than opposite-but-equivalent advantages help. Why? In large part because much of the world is designed around average people, with average trait abilities.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deficits-in-working-memory-as-an-example-of-asymmetries-in-function">Deficits in Working Memory as an example of asymmetries in function</h2>
<p>As a simple example (now thankfully somewhat historic due to the rise of smartphones) consider the ease with which someone with slightly worse-than-average working memory, and someone with slightly better-than-average working memory, would be able to remember and follow some verbal instructions about how to get from <em>here</em> to <em>there</em>. The person asked for the directions, who is likely to have average working memory - let’s say <strong>5</strong> elements - is then likely to offer instructions of no more than their own working memory capacity: <em>first you (1), until you get to (2), then turn (3), at (4), and look for (5)</em>. For someone whose working memory capacity is a bit lower (say <strong>4</strong> elements) such instructions are <em>almost always</em> likely to be forgotten by the end; either the entire instruction set is likely to be forgotten in trying to squeeze <strong>5 into 4</strong>, or the last, critical, piece of the instruction set is likely to be forgotten, and so someone else will need to be asked. Conversely, for someone whose working memory capacity is a bit higher than average (say <strong>6</strong> elements), they will be able to remember the complete instruction set no better than the person whose working memory capacity is average. One element more isn’t as much better as one element less is worse: the practical navigation test is <em>pass-or-fail</em>, and being only slightly below average can mean <em>always failing</em>.</p>

<section id="the-glass-cannon" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-glass-cannon">The Glass Cannon</h2>
<p>There’s another term I’m aware from games, about exceptionally <em>unbalanced</em> character builds: <strong>glass cannons</strong>. Both exceptionally powerful, <em>and</em> exceptionally fragile, the glass cannon is a high-risk build, not for the faint of heart. But a glass cannon, surrounded and supported by a team of adventurers with complementary skills and a willingness to shield the glass cannon’s fragilities, can be exceptionally strong, and achieve much more than a balanced team would ever be capable of.</p>
<p>So the <strong>weak version of the Deficit Model</strong> I think worth defending is something like <em>many apparent geniuses are cognitive glass cannons</em>, who have somehow found themselves in the kind of protective and supportive environments where their exceptional strengths in one or two traits can flourish, while their many deficits in other traits can be mitigated, somewhat at least, by their specific social and institutional millieu.</p>

<section id="the-artistic-genius" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-artistic-genius">The Artistic Genius</h2>
<p>So far, most of my discussion of <strong>The Genius Myth</strong> has focused on what might be called <em>scientific geniuses</em>. But a number of examples Lewis gives are of <em>artistic geniuses</em>. I think I draw more a distinction between these two types of genius than Lewis does. Though maybe not. When it comes to <em>artistic geniuses</em> Lewis’ main concerns are that the designation of <em>genius</em> has historically been used by such designees as social licence for bad behaviour. Unlike mere mortals, such genius creatives <em>should be</em> allowed to indulge in selfish, harmful, hateful, cruel and lascivious behaviour. In fact, such behaviours, and the proclivities and instincts that guide them, may even be the <em>source of their genius</em>, their <em>muse</em>, and so should be - if anything - encouraged.</p>
<p>As well as referencing the adolescent-male-pornographic preoccupations of much of Salvador Dali (most of what he painted <em>wasn’t</em> melted clock faces, but idealised womens’ bodies), Lewis devotes a chapter - <strong>Monsters and Tortured Artists</strong> - to the works of English playwright Chris Goode, whose predatory peadophilic impulses seemed to drive much of his artistic output, as well as his highly unprofessional behaviour towards the many young men and boys he recruited to realise abstractions of his sexual fantasies on the stage. Lewis suggests, I think quite plausibly, that Goode’s homosexuality meant a double standard was applied by critics when encountering his onstage kinks, as compared with an equally horny, youth-focused, and predatory heterosexual male. <a href="../../../posts/unpop/brother-lee-the-antimonk/index.html">My post on William S Burroughs</a>, inspired by the positive critical reception to the recent film adaptation of <em>Queer</em>, hopefully illustrates why I’m largely in sympathy this position. There should not be double standards, no differential treatment in relation to sex, nor sexuality, nor any other immutable characteristics.</p>
<p>But as with the strong and weak version of the Deficit Model, I think there might be a need for a similar distinction between strong and weak versions of arguments about Artistic Geniuses as Self-Indulgers and Self-Expressors. If the strong version is as described above - someone who publicly revels and marinates in their basest carnal instincts and desires, and demands others applaud their indulgences - what might a defensible weak version look like?</p>
<p>To me the defensible weak version is something like the following: art that honestly expresses the shadows in (first and foremost) the artist’s character, and through this helps the consumer of such art to recognise such shadows as essential features of the human condition.<sup>9</sup> Without a willingness on behalf of the artist to express their own darker aspects, and without the consumer’s willingness to look at such depictions of weakness and darkness without reactionary condemnation, the capacity for art to facilitate feelings of compassion, empathy, tolerance and forgiveness is never developed. More abstractly, a culture that cannot tolerate honest expressions of darkness by artists is one in which the shadow is forever dis-integrated from the self, and so more likely to become expressed only in pathology.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous quote related to this idea is Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s, that “The line separating good from evil passes … through every human heart.” The quote in full, seldom quoted, is worth considering:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either – but right through every human heart – and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/450864-the-line-separating-good-and-evil-passes-not-through-states">Source</a></p>
<p>So, in context, Solzhenitsyn’s quote argues that the failure to recognise both the capacity for evil in ourselves and others we consider ‘good’, and for goodness in those we consider enemies, can lead to a kind of Manichean tribalism, a mentality of binary sorting - good guys like <em>us</em>; bad guys like <em>them</em> - and from this an implicit moral license to overlook flaws and transgressions in <em>us</em>, and to do righteous harm to those we consider <em>them.</em></p>
<p>Art that promotes critical reflection on the shadows within ourselves, and the virtues in our enemies, of course isn’t the only art worth having. Art which evokes a more general sense of transcendence and awe in the natural world may be another category of art invaluable contribution to humanity. But the weak version of the <strong>Monster and Tortured Artist</strong> myth I think worth defending and saving is that of the artist willing to look unflinchingly and represent honestly the flaws in themselves, and through this to quietly promote consolation and compassion through such critical reflection. The line in practice between reflecting on one’s shadows, and indulging and reveling in one’s darkness, may at times be blurry and indistinct, but I think is worth maintaining. A crude reading of Lewis’ chapter framed around Goode may lead us to conclude we should simply be more intolerant, more ready to condemn, artists who bring their own shadows to light, the worst possible outcome of which would be cow such troubled souls into a permanent state of dishonesty and hypocrisy, forever forced to pretend to be a caricature of virtue, while underneath letting their shadows quietly metastasize in the darkness. That way, I think, ultimately lies a more intolerant, more hate-filled, and ultimately less beautiful world.</p>

<section id="concluding-thoughts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
<p>This post has been somewhere between a review of <strong>The Genius Myth</strong>, and a kind of reverie inspired by it. If the mark of a good book is that it inspires in readers a wish or need to think deeply about the topics and themes it raises, then surely <strong>The Genius Myth</strong> is, to my estimation, a good book. As with the previous section, however, perhaps it’s good in this sense in large part <em>because</em> of its flaws? Its breezy anecdotal style; its looseness with definitions; its impression and conceit as a somewhat staid act of progressive revisionism, which it then (thankfully) never quite manages to live up to.</p>
<p>Recently, Lewis reports that so far sales and/or critical engagement of <strong>The Genius Myth</strong> <a href="https://helenlewis.substack.com/p/the-bluestocking-379-the-economics">have been somewhat disappointing</a>. Perhaps this reflects a more general trend for full length nonfiction books themselves to have become a harder sell in an age of ever more fractured attentions and in particular - either fittingly or ironically from Lewis’ perspective, given her ubiquity in the medium - due to the rising popularity of long-form podcasts as ways of scratching the nonfiction itch for information. Perhaps it’s due to the question of Genius not being an especially hot topic at the moment, even if it emanates some evergreen warmth.</p>
<p>Or perhaps (to say the quiet part out loud) <strong>The Genius Myth</strong> ultimately just isn’t an especially insightful or focused contribution to the topic. I don’t know. It’s definitely been an interesting read from my perspective, which has sparked a lot of ideas… hence the length of this blog post!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><a href="../../../posts/unpop/no-longer-understanding/index.html">Previously I wrote</a> about how the main logo, ident or icon for the Stand comedy club in Glasgow and Edinburgh - a goofy child cowboy - became altered in a way that makes it politer, on the one hand, but symbolically meaningless, on the other. A bit like the British Petroleum rebranding as <strong>BP</strong>, and then declaring that these two letters now no longer stand for anything, the Stand’s goofy cowboy is still around, but in a sense no longer performs.</p>
<p>Anyway, walking around Edinburgh yesterday I chanced upon a little more background on the ident, the artist who painted it, and the fated juxtaposition that led the club to disarm the boy:</p>

<p>(I’d suggest it <em>seemed</em> like a great visual analogy for the performance of stand-up because it <em>is</em>.)</p>

<section id="waiting-area" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="waiting-area">Waiting Area</h2>
<p>Jim puts his head in his hands. Or at least he tries to. The hands don’t quite reach, arrested by the chains.</p>
<p>Jim lowers his head to his hands and groans.</p>
<p>The noise, all around, bad at the best of the times, and this isn’t the best of times. Noise, noise, noise from without, noise from within.</p>
<p>Jim doesn’t know why he’s here. Or at least that’s what he tells himself. Part of him - his guts, his spleen - knows <em>exactly</em> why he’s here. That’s why the other bits of him, the mouth and the tongue and the neck and the skull and the throbbing grey goo inside, would rather not listen to the insistent noises below.</p>
<p>“10872!”. A languid voice bellows with an indignant, officious tone. “10872!”</p>
<p>Jim remembers the coupon scrolled in his hand. Unfurling. Tongue moves softly, tracing the digits.</p>
<p>“won… oh … ate… seven… too!”</p>
<p>Jim stands, steps forward, trips over. Skull falls onto stained cyan carpet.</p>
<p>“You have to wait for an officer to unlock you,” the voice at the desk drawls. “We’re not exactly free range here.”</p>
<p>Jim pulls himself back into a jangly ball, pivots himself against the front of the bench, and hops to a stand.</p>
<p>The polyester shuffle gets louder, becoming a ring of keys.</p>
<p>“10872?” asks the mouth behind the ring.</p>
<p>“Erm, yeah!” confirms Jim.</p>
<p>“Up a bit.” Sleeves gesture at hands.</p>
<p>Jim obliges.</p>
<p>“Wait a bit. Hold it.” A tongue appears in the corner of the mouth. The keys start to circle around the ring, each engraved number scanned. “I think it’s this one,” says the mouth to itself. The ring is thrust, index key first, into Jim’s cuffs. “Hold it!”, the mouth repeats.</p>
<p>Twisting, grabbing, pushing, prodding. Then a turn. The tension drops from Jim’s wrists, from the cuffs to the ankles to the back of the bench.</p>
<p>“Follow me”.</p>
<p>Jim shambles along in the mouth’s wake.</p>
<p>“Is this an office or a jail?” Jim wonders to himself.</p>
<p>“Both,” answers the mouth. “Back in the day, just an office. Then there was that whole work-from-home craze, and then for a while it was nothing. Then it was a squat. And then it was ours.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I didn’t realise I asked that out loud.”</p>
<p>“Your lot often doesn’t.”</p>
<p><em>My lot?</em>, wonders Jim.</p>
<p>“Anyway, of course the squatters didn’t want to leave.” The mouth licks its lips. “But then once they’d been convicted, they ended up here. And then the didn’t want to <em>stay</em>!” <strong>Bronchial spluttering</strong>. (Silence)</p>
<p>(Silence.)</p>
<p>(Silence.)</p>
<p>“Case adviser’s in there,” says the mouth. The polyester straight-arm salutes the door of an office in a box.</p>
<p>Jim looks at the mouth and the uniform.</p>
<p>“In there,” says the mouth.</p>
<p>Jim shambles <em>in there</em>, pushing open the door by knocking against the kickplate.</p>
</section>
<section id="outer-room" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outer-room">Outer Room</h2>
<p>“Come in!” says the box’s occupant. “Come in! Come in!” A smile. Genuine. (You can see it in the eyes. And hear it in the voice.) The occupant wears a shirt, short-sleeved, crinkling slightly as he moves. Glasses, wire-framed. A moustache that looks like it used to be more distinctively zoned, whose boundaries are fuzzier against a half-week’s growth of pepper-grey hairs on cheek, chin and neck. His build is on the hard edge of soft. From his skin the man looks to be in his late thirties, pale, red threaded.</p>
<p>“Take a seat,” says the man, gesturing to a worn swivelchair.</p>
<p>Jim obliges.</p>
<p>“Hi!” says the man, extending his hand in greeting. “I’m Kevin; and I’ll by your CDSO during your visit here.”</p>
<p>“What’s a CDSO?” asks Jim.</p>
<p>“Sorry for the ETLA,” says Kevin, chuckling lightly to himself. “Case and Decision Support Officer.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” says Jim, seated.</p>
<p>“So,” says Kevin. “Have you thought some on The Decision? Any preferences? <em>TBJ</em>, or <em>TBO</em>?”</p>
<p>“What?!” exclaims Jim.</p>
<p>Kevin looks at Jim for a second. “You really don’t know. Haven’t you been following the news for the last couple of years? It’s been the big flagship policy the current lot came in on.”</p>
<p>Jim looks blankly.</p>
<p>“You really don’t know, do you?” Kevin pauses, recalling the form of words. “The TBO initiative was introduced to improve criminal justice outcomes for the three main stakeholders in our sector: the victim, the perpetrator, and the taxpayer. As I said, it’s the current lot’s big idea, and very popular with voters. After they did the pilot programme over in Northern Ireland they mostly sorted out the wrinkles and it got rolled out nationwide. And over there, next door, I’m pleased to tell you we’ve got one of our brand new TBO units, last safety inspection just six weeks ago, all prepped and ready to use.” Kevin pauses. “If you go for the TBO path, of course. <em>It’s your choice</em>.”</p>
<p>Jim looks more carefully at the room they’re in. Beyond and facing the nondescript office door he entered the room through is a second, much sturdier door, metal, by the looks of it much thicker, looking a bit like something that fit in a bank vault or a submarine.</p>
<p>Jim first realises that the room they’re in is more wide than long, as if it were just one third of an initially cuboid space.</p>
<p>Jim looks now at the wall in which the vault-like door is inset, and from the sturdiness and apparent thickness of the inner door infers that the entire wall is much thicker than the wall containing the office space. Jim notes that the vault-like door is inset slightly against the apparent contours of the wall, and from this infers that the inner wall itself is covered by a thin facade, chipboard perhaps, which has been papered and painted the same light green as the other three walls of the drably officious outer sanctum he currently understands himself to be sitting in. About halfway along the width of the wall, and about two fifths of the way down the wall, Jim sees a light curtain rail from which some light crimson drapes are suspended. Jim thinks he can make out some rivets recessed slightly behind the drapes.</p>
<p>“Yes!” says Kevin. “It’s all over there. We’re an integrated service here. Just a one minute walk, no delays.”</p>
<p>Jim turns back to face Kevin ‘behind’ the small desk. A very small desk, in fact, more like a coffee table, round, slightly to one side. On this small desk: a charging stand with a rubber-enclosed tablet computer, and a squatter, wider stand with the following words written, by the looks of it, in some professionalised derivative of comic sans.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Kevin Peterson, PhD Senior Case/Decision Support Officer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“What’s a per-her-der?” asks Jim.</p>
<p>Kevin grins. “Pee aitch Dee.” He pauses. “A doctorate (Too much time in school.) I got it in criminal psychology, about eight years ago. Back when a lot of this stuff was more theoretical.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” says Jim.</p>
<p>“Anyway, enough about me. This is <em>your</em> meeting. I’m here to support and guide you through your Criminal Justice Journey. This meeting is <em>your</em> meeting. It’s <em>your</em> Decision.”</p>
<p>“My decision?”, asks Jim.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Kevin exhales, then speaks more slowly and clearly, as if to a child or an invalid. “<em>TBJ</em>… <em>or</em>… <em>TBO</em>?” Kevin waits and stares.</p>
<p>Jim blinks.</p>
<p>“Let’s get your case file up…” Kevin picks up the tablet and starts prodding. After a few seconds he stops, eyes saccading, frowns, and forces his mouth back upright.</p>
<p>“So…” Kevin speaks deliberatively. He inhales. “You’re ‘accused’ of killing a cat, last night, at 1:03am, on King Street. As well as the usual drunk and disorderly.”</p>
<p>Jim’s eyes widen and start to tear up. “I’m accused of doing <em>what</em>?!” he exclaims. “But I love cats!”</p>
<p>“I said ‘accused’ with inverted commas,” Kevin clarifies, this time quivering the first two fingers of his free hand, like bunny ears, while saying ‘accused’. “With my TBO hat on, and my very similar looking Common Sense hat on, I can just say this: You killed a cat. You’ve done wrong. How are you going to make this right?”</p>
<p>Jim realises that Kevin’s face is now less than two hand lengths from his own, as with each of the previous fifteen words Kevin had heanty ever closer towards Jim’s eyes. Jim can smell the tuna sandwich that Kevin had for lunch.</p>
<p>Kevin straightens and backs up again, returning to a more comfortable distance. “Of course, from the TBJ perspective, you’re just ‘accused’ at this stage. ‘Innocent until proven guilty’, as they still sometimes say. But we’ve already got…” Kevin scrolls down on the tablet. “… three eyewitness statements, two Ring camera records (with audio), and blood and fur samples recovered from your right shoe and tracksuit bottoms.”</p>
<p>Only now does Jim realise he’s wearing open sandals he’s never owned, and this his trousers appear to be made of thick green paper.</p>
<p>“And of course,” Kevin continues, “we’ve got this recorded by the arresting officer at 1.42am last night…” Kevin jabs a button on the tablet.</p>
<p>“Oh my God!”, cries the tablet in Jim’s voice. “I’ve killed a cat! I’ve killed a cat! What the hell have I done?! I’ve killed a cat!”</p>
<p>“But of course,” continues Kevin, “statements made by intoxicated individuals aren’t considered especially high quality evidence. In isolation, it wouldn’t have been enough.”</p>
<p>Jim is a quietly heaving, deflated thing, arms draped awkwardly, face to floor, back round and quivering.</p>
<p>Kevin waits momentarily. “So,” he begins, “to repeat, you’ve basically got two options. (Well, technically two-and-a-half, I guess, but anyway…): You can go down the TBJ route, where you’re ‘just accused’ of all this (or you could plead guilty, the half option, but that’s not really too different to the TBJ path in practice). Or you could go down the TBO route, where you accept you did it, and it can all be resolved in the next hour.”</p>
<p>Jim arrests his sniffles and raises his head. “Wait… what day is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s Sunday, James.”</p>
<p>“Shit!”, says Jim. “I can’t miss work tomorrow. They’ll fire me.”</p>
<p>“Well,” says Kevin, “in that case the only chance you’ve got of getting to work tomorrow is the TBO route. We’re looking at a…” - Kevin prods the tablet - “… 22 month delay for trials.”</p>
<p>“And if I just plead guilty?”</p>
<p>“Even that’s quite backed up too. Currently we’re looking at a …” - more prodding on the tablet - “13 week delay to see a circuit judge to hear the plea.”</p>
<p>“Could I work while I wait?”</p>
<p>“We don’t do that anymore.” Kevin shakes his head. “You’d have to spend the wait in jail. Currently things are getting a little better there. You’ll be looking at..” - more prodding - ” 1.13 square metres (estimated average stay) to yourself while you’re with us. And you’ll be sharing a latrine with just 41 other guests.”</p>
<p>Jim pauses. In a half whisper he says, “I’ll pick TBO.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?” asks Kevin.</p>
<p>“I’ll pick TBO. I <em>did it</em>. I’ll choose TBO. I’m <em>choosing</em> TBO. Thank you!”</p>
<p>“Great!”, exclaims Kevin, jumping to a stand. “Let’s hope Algos and Stochastos are smiling today.” Kevin winks.</p>
<p>“Who?” asks Jim.</p>
<p>“The gods, Algos and Stochastos. Though they might sound a bit foreign they’re proudly made in Britain. First we’ve got Algos. He listens and weights…”</p>
<p>“Waits for what?” asks Jim.</p>
<p>“Not <em>waits</em>,” Kevin chuckles. “Weights! As in, like heavier or lighter, more weight to <em>this</em> side, or to <em>that</em> side. Algos, you see, he’s fair, and he listens. He listens to <em>The Chorus</em>, fifteen freshly picked members from the Good Citizens Panel. They look, they hear, they have a quick think, then they tell Algos what they reckon about what they’ve seen and heard.”</p>
<p>“Fifteen, like a big jury?”</p>
<p>“Technically a Chorus isn’t a jury. But they do have a quick look at some materials and try to answer and grade some questions. But unlike a jury they just tend to focus on grading the State’s evidence, rather than listening to those overpaid fools in white wigs drone on for days and weeks on end, and the witnesses getting asked silly questions by the white wig brigade.” Kevin pauses. “That way, the Chorus can usually get set up and grading done in under an hour, sitting in their dressing gown over a glass of red wine at home. It’s so much more of an efficient system than the old jury way of doing things.”</p>
<p>Kevin looks some more at the tablet, scrolls up and down. He looks at Jim with a wide smile, almost giddy. “And I’m pleased to tell you that the grading for your case has already been completed, and told to Algos, all while we were having this chat. The Chorus spoke, Algos heard, and the weighting’s been finalised. Now it’s just over to Stochastos for the final stage. Over there please!” Kevin gestures to the vault-like door.</p>
<p>Jim stands, walks over, and reaches for the thick door’s handle.</p>
<p>“It’s open,” says Kevin. “Just give it a light push.”</p>
<p>Jim does as instructed. The heavy looking door glides about its axis almost effortlessly. Jim takes a couple of tall steps to clear the threshold.</p>
</section>
<section id="inner-room" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inner-room">Inner Room</h2>
<p>Inside, the room is covered - floor to wall to ceiling - in white tiles, with harsh, uniform lighting. The dimensions of this inner room are like those of the outer chamber, only a bit smaller, implying all walls of this door are of similar thickness to the vault door entrance. On the narrowest wall to his left a dark inset glass-like bulb is visible, jutting carefully from the wall. Something inside the bulb whirrs and lights up. A camera, operated elsewhere? Facing this presumed target-hardened camera, at the far side of the room, is a strange contraption of many parts.</p>
<p>At the top of the contraption is something like looks like a modified bicycle helmet held up by a thick, horizontal grey tube, coming out of the otherwise featureless wall to the left from Jim’s view. The helmet appears complete along the far side (the tube side), but parts are missing along its other side. Instead it looks adapted near the front and back to hold a currently loose, dangling pair of straps.</p>
<p>Below the modified bicycle helmet is something that looks like a patio chair with arm rests. The chair sits atop a height adjustable circular column, at the base of which are four concrete ‘feet’ which step astride - what is that? a gutter? - cutting deeper, and wider to the right than the left of the footed ‘pillar’ on which the seat sits. From Jim’s current position it’s difficult to know how deep the gully goes.</p>
<p>“There it is,” says Kevin, “Where Stochastos does her thing. Walk towards it. Check it out!”</p>
<p>“<em>Her</em> thing?” enquires Jim, stepping towards the garden throne contraption with a dream-like cadence.</p>
<p>“Call her Lady Luck if you like.” Kevin’s smile radiates through his voice. It sounds… warm. “Stochastos is her <em>Sunday Name.</em>”</p>
<p>Jim is now less than a metre and a half from the other end of the wall, and can see more of the Garden Throne and the gutter on which it bestrides. Now he can judge the depth and contours of the gutter more accurately. It almost looks like a sink, except inset into the ground, and instead of the back end finishing with a straight edge, it stetches back, under the four concrete ‘feet’ of the Garden Throne pillar, like the tail of a stingray.</p>
<p>Jim notices another feature on this end of the room. Opposite the bicycle helmet/tube contraption, on the opposing wall, an additional extra large, extra thick ceramic tile has been slotted against the wall, held in place by metal grooves on each side and below. The centre of this extra large, extra thick tile faces the centre of the tube holding the bicycle helmet.</p>
<p>“Take your throne,” says Kevin. “And I’ll adjust the height.”</p>
<p>Jim obliges, placing himself on the metal seat. There are arm rests with straps either side. Jim’s feet initially lay on the tile floor. Instinctively he swishes his feet forwards and backwards, like a child trying to escape gravity momentarily on a swing.</p>
<p>“For your safety,” says Kevin, “please place your arms within the security straps on each arm rest.”</p>
<p>Jim notices the arms are on top of the straps. Awkwardly he rearranges his limbs so the straps are above and the rests below.</p>
<p>“Now let’s get the right app up.” Kevin looks down at his tablet and swipes a few times, the edge of his tongue poking out one side of his mouth. “Ready now.” Kevin makes an assertive prod on his screen. The arm rests whirr and the straps tighten. They have some give, but not much. Jim now notices the impression of something, circular, indented, with a bit of give, beneath his right hand.</p>
<p>“Now let’s get the elevation sorted. (Unfortunately we can’t do pitch and yaw with this hot seat.)” Kevin chuckles to himself, stabs at his tablet. Servos whirr from below. Jim’s body shoots up, the top of his skull dabbing and now pressing, slightly uncomfortably, against the top of the helmet.</p>
<p>“This bit’s still manual. Let me help you.” Kevin walks up to Jim and the chair, his attention focused on the half metre strap that hangs and dangles from the pipe-end of the helmet. The tongue pokes out of the side of Kevin’s mouth again, and his brow furrows, as he reaches for the strap. “Hand-eye coordination. Never my strong suit.” Kevin mutters to himself, as he pulls and rotates the strap below and around Jim’s head. “Got it!”, Kevin says. The strap loops back down, back around Jim’s chin, and is secured a second time at its origin point. Kevin pulls down. Jim feels his head’s mobility has become much restricted. “Great,” says Kevin. “Safe and secure.” Kevin walks back and admires his manual labour.</p>
<p>“Now the next step: We just need to let the D Team know we’re ready for them.” Kevin pauses. “Luckily that’s just a button press as well, much like ordering a pizza.” Kevin looks at his tablet again, saccades, scrolls, jabs a couple of times, then theatrically moves his hand back, extends his forefinger, and presses firmly on the tablet one last time. Then, a couple of seconds later, he looks left, to the side of the room they did not enter from. Jim tries to do the same, but with his head secured only his eyes move.</p>
<p>Muffled sounds appear from behind the wall. It appears to be a conversation, though Jim cannot make out any words. Jim listens intently. The cadence sounds like a series of questions being asked, then answered with a simple affirmative or negative. The exchange lasts about twenty seconds. Then there is a pause, and then….</p>
<p><strong>Crunch! Thud!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Crunch! Thud!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Crunch! Thud!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Crunch! Thud!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Crunch! Thud!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Crunch! Thud!</strong></p>
<p>Six times! Each noise appears twice to Jim’s ears: in a muffled form, through the wall, to both ears. Then in a fainter, tinnier but oddly clearer form through the tube, through Jim’s right ear only. The sounds are ever so slightly out-of-sync, through clearly have the same origin.</p>
<p>“And six.” Jim notices that Kevin has been counting to himself. He’s smiling. Radiant with happiness even. Kevin notices that Jim has noticed him and offers a conspiratorial wink.</p>
<p>Kevin looks a picture of controlled mania in his expression, which he refuses to hide from Jim. “Unfortunately for this last big I’ve got to go back over there.” Kevin gestures at the room they came from. “Health and safety”, Kevin continues, as if quoting more than saying. “Ear damage,” he continues. “I even offered to sign a waiver…” Kevin drifts off. “But anyway, I’ve got to go back there.”</p>
<p>“Um, okay”, says Jim, trying to nod reassuringly, despite the strap under his chin.</p>
<p>Kevin makes a sheepish half-bow and steps back, turning and walking to the door, glancing back as he touches the handly, taking a cautious up-step to clear the threshold, bowing again through the door, turning, pulling the door through on the other side.</p>
<p>Jim hears the <strong>klang!</strong> of the door shutting, then the metallic scraping of the door mechanism being turned shut. Jim then hears some distant footsteps, behind the wall, moving towards him. Then he sees the curtains open up behind the viewing port. Kevin’s eyes are now looking at him behind the glass.</p>
<p>The eyes look down and sway slightly. A static jolt sounds through the room. Kevin’s voice follows.</p>
<p>“Hi Jim! Now, for this last bit you’ve just got to do a couple of things…”</p>
<p>“Erm, okay!” says Jim.</p>
<p>“Firstly, you should be able to feel a couple of things with your right hand. A couple of square-topped plastic things. You should just be able to see these too. They’re button covers.”</p>
<p>Jim glances down and feels with his hand. As described, both buttons are visible, both under clear plastic caps. Both buttons are lit from within, a bit like those fruit machines Jim remembers seeing in a museum. The left button is amber, the right button is red. Currently the left button is lit, shining a solid green light.</p>
<p>“The cover for the left button should now be flippable. Just take your first two fingers and feel for a catch just before the button itself. Press the catch in a bit and the cover should flip up, letting you press the button itself.”</p>
<p>Jim pauses. “Okay?”</p>
<p>Kevin pauses. “So can you press the catch release please?”</p>
<p>Jim does so. The catch springs up and away, revealing the green button as described.</p>
<p>Kevin’s mouth is not visible, but Jim can see from his eyes that he’s smiling. The tone of the voice in the intercom confirms this. “I’m sure you can guess the next step…”</p>
<p>“Open the other cover?” Jim asks.</p>
<p>“I guess I was wrong. No, next step is you <em>press</em> the green button.”</p>
<p>“Right. Sorry.” Jim’s forefinger reaches for the green button. Just like that antique fruit machine he feels the plastic surrounded by the metal ring. He presses the centre of the flat plastic surface down and feels a reassuring click. The light on the button changes instantly, from solid to flashing.</p>
<p>Then Jim hears something to his right. A rumbling rotary noise, clanging into action the moment Jim first pressed that button, then after a second whirring with what sounds (and feels) like an accelerating cadence. After about three more seconds the whirring sound has become a constant hum, speeding up no more. Jim listens to the rotary noise briefly. The hum flitters almost hypnotically, oddly reassuringly, almost a single tone, but not quite. Cycles within cycles.</p>
<p>“Great!” says Kevin through the intercom. Speaking with deliberate enunciation he continues. “Now just two last steps: open the right button’s catch, then press the button.”</p>
<p>Jim’s middle finger reaches for the cover catch on the right button’s cover, and presses down. Just like the first, the second button cover releases up and over. The unsheathed button is now flashing between two intensities of red light.</p>
<p>“Now press the red button. Or don’t. <em>It’s your choice!</em>”</p>
<p>Jim presses the button</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>As sites like <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">Our World in Data</a> and books like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature">The Better Angels of Our Nature</a> like to remind us, most of humanity has, materially, never had it so good. Gone are famine and infant mortality as experiential norms, gone even is the constant misery of tooth decay without effective dentistry. Through countless objective measures, for most of the world, for most of the twentieth and twenty-first century, the material conditions of life have continued to improve, the numbers of people alive to experience such improvements have continued to increase, and the gap between the poor and rich world (albeit as viewed on the logarithmic scale of dollars, tens of dollars and hundreds of dollars) has continued to decline.</p>
<p>But such evidence of continuing material progress - this decades-long Good News - seldom seems to be <em>felt</em> or to translate to clearly improved happiness and wellbeing amongst most of the population. Part of this relates to our perception of time and tendency to attend to the negative more than the positive: like climate change or the growth of a tree, material progress may just happen too slowly for us to see it; and evolutionarily it has been more adaptive to attend to the carnivorous predator than the juicy berries when both are in our environment. But much of this is likely related to hedonic adaptation and social comparison.</p>
<p>On hedonic adaptation: we <em>get used</em> to things maybe too quickly to appreciate how much better things are now than in the past. We get used to the world’s films and music being no more than a few clicks away on a magic brick, whereas our past selves would marvel at our current technology. The magic of the old becomes disenchanted and hum-drum, invisible to us except during its brief moments of failure: the wifi not connecting, the title being removed this week from the streaming service’s rota, and so on. We forget the technological magic of the present epoch, and so it quickly fails to make us happy.</p>
<p>Then there’s social comparison: mass media brought impressions of the rich, powerful, glamourous and beautiful onto the silver screen, then the living room, then the laptop, then to the palm of our hand. The lives and living standards of the most privileged fraction of a fraction of the top one percent of the world appear within touching distance. However, though we can see them, we can never be them. The screens through which we see their lives messes, in a profoundly harmful way, with our internal psychological architecture, encouraging ourselves to <em>compare ourselves with them</em>, and through this act of comparison almost always find ourselves lacking and wanting. Misery, the constant drip-feed misery of knowing how much less we are than them, emerges inevitably as a consequence.</p>
<p>Now, faced with this dilemma, those given to thought experiments - philosophers, effective altruists, other (often) autistic social systematisers - may be given to wonder the following: <em>what would happen if, instead of being constantly reminded of people with much more than us, we were instead constantly reminded of those with much less?</em> What if, instead of our ‘celebrities’ being persons whose lives we aspire to <em>attain</em>, instead our ‘celebrities’ were comprised exclusively of those whose lives we aspire to <em>avoid</em>?</p>
<p>Given our understanding of social comparison, we might might imagine a <em>hypothetical</em> world where our television and social media comprises accounts of the meek and miserable rather than the rich and glamourous as one where <em>almost everyone</em> would be happier. Why? Because <em>almost everyone</em>, no matter how hard life is for them, still has a better life than <em>that poor sod on the telly</em>. Mass media focusing on those with least, rather than those with most, would - from first principles - appear a <em>theoretically</em>, <em>hypothetically</em>, valid strategy for improving most people’s happiness without improving their material standing.</p>
<p>But here the thought experiment would end, because how else could this diet of misery and misfortune be sustained for the masses except by seeking out and keeping a few select people extremely miserable. What individuals, and what society, could tolerate inflicting and watching these anti-celebrities experience constant harm and hardship? Surely no civilised society would ever do this, or ever want to?</p>
<p>Well, that’s what I thought too: the anti-celebrity would forever (thankfully?) always remain a thought experiment. But then I saw a BBC documentary called <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002dt13">The Contestant</a>, which suggests that <em>in Japan, in the 1990s, the anti-celebrity thought experiment outlined above actually happened</em>! <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The details of The Contestant are as described in the blurb linked to above. A young man, Tomoaki Hamatsu, ethnically Japanese but still ostracised in Japan due to his unusually long face, decides to try to lean into his distinct appearance and try to develop a public profile in Tokyo as a celebrity. He applies for a segment on a reality TV show that usually involves travelling in unfamiliar parts of the world, and is instead essentially kidnapped, taken to a very small apartment, and told to strip. The apartment includes thousands of blank postcards and aisle of magazines, and he is told he may not leave the apartment, and that the only food, clothes, or other items he can have access to are those he wins in magazine prizes.</p>
<p>The segment the contestant (unwittingly) stared in was called Life in Prizes, lasted over a year, and was routinely watched by over ten million Japanese people each week. Over this period, Hamatsu nearly dies of starvation and starts to go insane with loneliness. He is encouraged to document his thoughts and feelings on camera, and in a journal. The journals, describing his constant hunger and misery, his loneliness, his suicidal ideation, stretch to four volumes, and become best-sellers.</p>
<p>How could this have happened? Could it have happened anywhere else? I don’t know, but Hamatsu’s ordeal - and the absolute and unmitigated joy that tens of millions of Japanese felt at seeing his constant hardships week after week, does reinforce the idea for me that <em>Japan, amongst high income nations, is culturally distinct</em>. In Japan, at the time, was Haratsu’s ordeal considered <em>for the greater good?</em> One person’s suffering to make millions of people happier? Did Haratsu’s physical and psychological torture <em>actually</em> improve Japanese wellbeing, thus empirically verifying the results of what I thought could only ever be a thought experiment. <sup>2</sup></p>
<p>I just don’t know. Just that, unlike with most research, I hope this finding <em>doesn’t</em> get replicated.</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>Note from Claude: The documentary “The Contestant” (directed by Clair Titley, released on Hulu May 2024) documents the verified ordeal of Tomoaki Hamatsu (“Nasubi”) on the Japanese reality show segment “A Life in Prizes” (part of “Susunu! Denpa Shonen”) which aired from January 1998 to April 1999. Nasubi lived alone and unclothed in a tiny apartment, surviving only on magazine sweepstakes winnings until he earned 1 million yen (~$8,000) in prizes. Crucially, while he knew he was being filmed, he had no idea the footage was being broadcast to over 15 million people weekly on Nippon TV. This predated “The Truman Show” (1998) and preceded the term “reality TV” entering cultural lexicon. The BBC’s Tokyo correspondent at the time, Juliet Hindell, was shocked that spectators found it amusing rather than brutal. Regarding hedonic adaptation and social comparison: research confirms these are well-established psychological phenomena. The “hedonic treadmill” describes how humans quickly return to stable happiness levels despite major life changes, and social comparison theory shows we recalibrate wellbeing by comparing to others around us. See <a href="https://time.com/6972667/the-contestant-hulu-nasubi-interview/">The Contestant on Hulu - Time Magazine</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill">Hedonic treadmill - Wikipedia</a>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Note from Claude: This phenomenon of finding collective relief through one person’s suffering connects to René Girard’s theory of the scapegoat mechanism, which profoundly influenced tech investor Peter Thiel. Girard’s mimetic theory posits that when humans mimic one another’s desires, inevitable conflict arises and is often resolved through “the scapegoat mechanism” - societies channel collective violence onto a single individual (often innocent) to restore order and release tensions. Thiel encountered Girard’s work at Stanford and credited it with shaping both his worldview and his decision to invest in Facebook. However, there’s a crucial distinction: Girard saw the task of modern thought as revealing and overcoming the scapegoat mechanism to defuse its power, whereas critics argue Thiel applies the theory instrumentally - believing in “the salvationary power of scapegoating as a positive project” and using technologies (Palantir, Facebook) to control mimetic violence for the protection of the powerful. The abuse and harassment endemic to social media may thus be “features, not bugs” - platforms channeling mimetic desire also serve as conduits for the scapegoating violence that accompanies it. See <a href="https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2016/08/13/mimesis-violence-and-facebook-peter-thiels-french-connection-full-essay/">Mimesis, Violence, and Facebook: Peter Thiel’s French Connection - Cyborgology</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rene-Girard">René Girard - Britannica</a>.↩︎</p></li>

</figure>
</div>
<p>One of the few things Glasgow and Edinburgh share, other than latitude, is <a href="https://www.thestand.co.uk/">the Stand Comedy Club</a>, a chain of venues where both beginners can try their hand at stand-up comedy, and seasoned professionals can test out a minute or two of new materials to help decide whether it should make the cut and become part of a new set.</p>
<p>I’ve walked by both the Glasgow and Edinburgh venues many times, each time struck by their distinct ident, which looks as shown at the start of this post.</p>
<p>So, a goofy looking kid, dressed as a cowboy, grinning awkwardly in a harsh blue spotlight. The ident is familiar to me, but also not. It triggers, for me, my own variant of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Mandela-effect">Mandala Effect</a>, of distinctly remembering how the past used to be distinctly, definitively different to how it’s now presented as being and always having been.</p>
<p>Search online for The Stand (Edinburgh or Glasgow) and this same ident -the goofy, blue-light bathed cowboy kid - tends to get returned. It’s largely only my memory that tells me this ident wasn’t always this. It used to be different, in one specific but important way.</p>
<p>The Stand’s past has largely been erased. But not completely. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg3evpd5dvjo">This story from the BBC</a> shows how this ident used to be.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>This was the mural at the back of the stage. From memory (imperfect as it is) the bluetone ident was similarly different too. Originally, the ident for The Stand was a boy dressed as a cowboy, <em>with a revolver to his head</em>.</p>
<p>This one difference, to me, made all the difference. It said something, memorable engaging, harsh, arresting. And it said it instantly. What the original ident said to me was the following:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If you go to The stand, you might see people <em>die</em> on stage. If you perform at the Stand, <em>you</em> might die on stage. You’ll die on stage because you weren’t prepared, because you’re just pretending to be able to do this to engage and entertain others - but you can’t really do this.. You are, in fact, just a cowboy. Not even a cowboy; a make-believe cowboy. However, because you’re just playing, don’t worry. You’re not a real cowboy, and what you’ve put up against your head isn’t a real gun, even if you do really put it up against your head and pull the trigger. You aim. You miss. You die on stage.</p>

<p>But you don’t actually die. After ‘dying on stage’, you’ll feel terrible. But then you get to slump off, put yourself together, and try to die a bit less next time. Eventually, you might even learn to become what you’re only pretending to be.</p>

<p>Though I can understand why the revolver was deleted from the ident, all I can now think of when I see the new ident is the old ident: the ident that told a complex and arresting story in a single image, the ident that had meaning beyond its being a recognisable brand or identity. On its own merits, without its buried history, the new ident says or means very little, and isn’t something on its own I’d find very memorable. At most, I might just think “isn’t that just a cheap rip-off of <a href="https://www.tomrichmond.com/history-of-an-idiot/20/06/2017/">the Mad TV kid</a>?”</p>
<p><strong>Coda</strong>: <em>The Stand aren’t completely in denial about their past ident. I walked by the Edinburgh venue recently, and saw this poster. The clue’s in the cake!</em></p>
