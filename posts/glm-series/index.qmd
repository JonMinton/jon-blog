I now have four fairly technical posts that form part of a series on understanding statistical modelling from a generalised linear regression (GLM) perspective. This series is far from complete, but is complete enough that it should be fairly useful to intrepid readers. 

To make it easier to find this series, I've now created a page for links just to entries in this series. To see this, just look on the top left of this site, and click on 'generalised linear models'.
