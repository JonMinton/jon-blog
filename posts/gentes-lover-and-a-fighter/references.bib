	abstract = {Aims: The aim of this study was to estimate whether the risk for total and cause-specific mortality was related to employment status, and whether mortality in different non-employed groups differed during high and low levels of unemployment. Methods: Structured interviews were used from the Swedish Survey of Living Conditions in 1984—89 and 1992—97, including women and men aged 18 to 64, classified as unemployed (n=2,067), retired or on temporary disability pension (n=2,674), economically inactive for other reasons (n=1,373), and employed (n=38,293). Data were linked to death certificates, as registered in the Cause of Death Register. Cox proportional hazards models were performed for the mortality risk up until eight and a half years following the interview. Results: Being unemployed (OR=1.43), retired, or on temporary disability pension (OR=2.28) or being economically inactive for other reasons (OR=1.63) was related to a risk for total mortality, after considering the level of unemployment, sociodemographic factors and longstanding illness. The risk of death due to external causes was excessive among the unemployed and among those retired or on temporary disability pension, and resulted to a large extent from suicide. The interaction between employment status and level of unemployment was not significant. Conclusions: The level of unemployment seems to have no major influence on the mortality risk. Future interventions for the non-employed groups should focus on preventing avoidable mortality, such as injury and suicide.},

            Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) has now been collecting a range of data from its nationally representative sample of participants for 10 years. This significant ‘birthday’ offers a moment to reflect on its contribution to sociological research, and on its current and future potential for fundamental and cutting-edge sociological analysis. While the study shares many features with other longer-standing household panel studies, including its direct predecessor the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), it incorporated from the outset distinctive features that make it particularly valuable for analysis in specific fields, including biosocial research, ethnicity and migration studies, and analyses of the interplay between environmental, social and institutional contexts and individual characteristics. Understanding Society has incorporated methodological development and innovation since its inception, which has facilitated more extensive forms of data collection.},

	abstract = {The UK is one of the countries with high share of population claiming health-related out of work benefits. Its share of claimants is reaching 6\% of the working age population (Beatty and Fothergill, 2015). Share of working population on incapacity benefits exhibits a distinct spatial pattern with significantly lower share in the South East and pockets of higher claims in former mining areas. The persistence and the spatial disparity of incapacity benefit claims has been linked to the pattern of structural changes in the UK economy, deindustrialization, decline in manufacturing. Regional and local job opportunities influence the decision to apply for incapacity benefits. While the unemployment rates and incapacity claimant rates are potentially endogenously determined, household income represents the employment opportunities and can therefore account for the variation in the disability claims rates across localities. The aim of the study is to explain the incapacity benefit claims at the level of UK local authorities using the following variables: average household income for the locality, industry sector employment shares, educational qualifications, age profile, share of self-employed. Spatial econometrics model is used because local authority claiming rates exhibit spatial dependence. The analysis uses income data produced by Horizon 2020 IMAJINE project. The findings of this study are important for understanding the impact of welfare reform onincapacity benefit uptake.},

	abstract = {During the 1980s and 1990s, there was a steep rise in disability benefit claims in Britain, especially among older male workers, and the debate centred on the relative generosity of these benefits as well as the effects of deindustrialization. Since that time, the disability benefit system has been subject to a series of reforms, all largely aimed at reducing the number of claims and targeting benefits more closely to those with the greatest health need. At the same time, the labour market has also evolved, and until the recent Covid‐19 pandemic, it had a historically low level of unemployment, accompanied by falling real earnings. We use individual longitudinal data from 2010 to 2018 in a dynamic panel framework to explore the relative importance of health status, benefit generosity and local labour market conditions for disability benefit claims in the modern British labour market. We focus particularly on spatial variation in claims, and find that, in line with older evidence, while health status is clearly important, geographic variation in labour market conditions still influences the propensity to claim those disability benefits that are conditional on not working.},

The resulting 12-item short-form (SF-12) achieved multiple R squares of 0.911 and 0.918 in predictions of the SF-36 Physical Component Summary and SF-36 Mental Component Summary scores, respectively. Scoring algorithms from the general population used to score 12-item versions of the two components (Physical Components Summary and Mental Component Summary) achieved R squares of 0.905 with the SF-36 Physical Component Summary and 0.938 with SF-36 Mental Component Summary when cross-validated in the Medical Outcomes Study. Test-retest (2-week)correlations of 0.89 and 0.76 were observed for the 12-item Physical Component Summary and the 12-item Mental Component Summary, respectively, in the general US population (n=232). Twenty cross-sectional and longitudinal tests of empirical validity previously published for the 36-item short-form scales and summary measures were replicated for the 12-item Physical Component Summary and the 12-item Mental Component Summary, including comparisons between patient groups known to differ or to change in terms of the presence and seriousness of physical and mental conditions, acute symptoms, age and aging, self-reported 1-year changes in health, and recovery for depression. In 14 validity tests involving physical criteria, relative validity estimates for the 12-item Physical Component Summary ranged from 0.43 to 0.93 (median=0.67) in comparison with the best 36-item short-form scale. Relative validity estimates for the 12-item Mental Component Summary in 6 tests involving mental criteria ranged from 0.60 to 107 (median=0.97) in relation to the best 36-item short-form scale. Average scores for the 2 summary measures, and those for most scales in the 8-scale profile based on the 12-item short-form, closely mirrored those for the 36-item short-form, although standard errors were nearly always larger for the 12-item short-form.},

            Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) has now been collecting a range of data from its nationally representative sample of participants for 10 years. This significant ‘birthday’ offers a moment to reflect on its contribution to sociological research, and on its current and future potential for fundamental and cutting-edge sociological analysis. While the study shares many features with other longer-standing household panel studies, including its direct predecessor the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), it incorporated from the outset distinctive features that make it particularly valuable for analysis in specific fields, including biosocial research, ethnicity and migration studies, and analyses of the interplay between environmental, social and institutional contexts and individual characteristics. Understanding Society has incorporated methodological development and innovation since its inception, which has facilitated more extensive forms of data collection.},

              The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the methods used for estimating the population attributable fraction (PAF) to leisure-time physical inactivity (PI) of coronary artery diseases, hypertension and stroke in order to provide the best available estimate for PAF.
            
            
              Design
              Systematic review.
            
            
              Data sources
              Four electronic databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) were searched from inception to August 2018.
            
            
              Eligibility criteria for selecting studies
              This review included prospective cohort studies, with men and women aged ≥18 years old, investigating the PAF attributable to leisure-time PI related to coronary artery diseases, hypertension and stroke.
            
            
              Results
              The PAF estimates of the three studies included were 13\% (3\%–22\%) for ‘stage-1 hypertension’ subtype incidence due to ‘non-regular exercise’; 25\% (10.4\%–35.8\%) for ‘stage-2 hypertension’ subtype incidence due to ‘activity of daily living’ and ‘vigorous-intensity sports’; and 8.5\% (1.7\%–16.7\%) for ‘total: fatal and non-fatal’ cardiovascular events of ‘incidence and mortality’ endpoints due to non-accumulation of 550 kcal/week (subsets not specified).
            
            
              Conclusions
              The PAF estimate exhibited a protective dose–response relationship between hypertension and an increased amount of energy expenditure of leisure-time PI. In order to enhance accuracy of PAF estimates, the following steps are recommended: (1) to clearly define and state the working definition of leisure-time PI and dose using a reliable and valid objective measurement tool; (2) use a clear definition of outcome subtypes and endpoints using reliable and valid objective measures; and (3) estimate PAF using modelling techniques based on prospective data and ensuring to report 95\% CI.},

	abstract = {Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for numerous non‐communicable diseases which dominate the overall burden of disease in Switzerland. We aimed to estimate the burden attributable to adult physical inactivity in Switzerland and its three culturally different language regions from a societal perspective in terms of disability‐adjusted life years (DALYs), medical costs, and productivity losses. The burden of physical inactivity was estimated with a population attributable fractions (PAFs) approach. PAFs were calculated based on the prevalence of physical inactivity in the Swiss Health Survey and literature‐based adjusted risk ratios of disease incidence. These PAFs were then applied to the total burden of the diseases related to physical inactivity. Physical inactivity was responsible for 2.0\% (95\%CI 1.7\%‐2.2\%) of total DALYs lost and 1.2\% (95\%CI 1.0\%‐1.3\%) of total medical costs in 2013. This is equivalent to 116 (95\%CI 99‐135) Swiss francs per capita per year. Productivity losses were valued at 117 (95\%CI 94‐142) Swiss francs per capita per year. The two diseases which caused the highest economic burden were low back pain and depression. The analysis of regional differences revealed that the per capita burden of physical inactivity is about twice as high in the French‐ and Italian‐speaking regions compared to the German‐speaking region. Reasons include a higher prevalence of physical inactivity, higher per capita health care spending, and higher disease prevalence. Cost‐effectiveness analysis of related interventions should consider regional differences for optimal resource allocation in physical activity promotion policies.},

              The widespread use of video games has raised concerns about their potential negative impact on mental well-being. Nevertheless, the empirical evidence supporting this notion is largely based on correlational studies, warranting further investigation into the causal relationship. Here we identify the causal effect of video gaming on mental well-being in Japan (2020–2022) using game console lotteries as a natural experiment. Employing approaches designed for causal inference on survey data (
              n
               = 97,602), we found that game console ownership, along with increased game play, improved mental well-being. The console ownership reduced psychological distress and improved life satisfaction by 0.1–0.6 standard deviations. Furthermore, a causal forest machine learning algorithm revealed divergent impacts between different types of console, with one showing smaller benefits for adolescents and females while the other showed larger benefits for adolescents. These findings highlight the complex impact of digital media on mental well-being and the importance of considering differential screen time effects.},
