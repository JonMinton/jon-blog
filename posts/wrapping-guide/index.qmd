Here's the key information I've learned from watching too many Youtube videos on how to wrap presents over the years.

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB

start[Presents to Wrap]
decision{Are they cuboid?}
box(Put them in a cuboid)
action(Wrap them)
finish[Presents are wrapped]

start --> decision
decision -->|yes| action
decision -->|no| box
box --> action
action --> finish

```

You're welcome!
