Just a quick update that [my long post on statistical significance and hypothesis testing](../glms/one-off/p-values-stat-sig/index.qmd) is now also [a page on my statistics website](https://jonminton.github.io/JonStats/pages/extra-courses/p-values-stat-sig/). Hopefully this means it should be easier to find alongside other statistical methods material.
