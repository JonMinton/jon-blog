I've now taken a lot of my statistics blog material and turned it into a website, available [here](https://jonminton.github.io/JonStats/pages/extra-courses/hacker-stats/). 

Basically, think of this blog as a 'staging area' for statistics material in development, and the stats website as a place where this material is deployed once entire 'courses' on particular topics have been completed, rather than in development. 

Feedback on typos, errors and omissions very welcome!
