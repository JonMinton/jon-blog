In trying to write up some thoughts about the recent riots and protests, I decided to try to confirm what proportion of the population of Rwanda practice Islam, as one of the few details known about the knife attack perpetrator is that his family is from Rwanda. But also that many of the riots and protests seem to be anti-Islamic and to be targetting mosques as well as migrants. 

And here's where things get weird. 

When I look on Google for 'religion in Rwanda', I get some preview text for the Wikipedia page which states that Rwanda is a majority Christian nation:

However, when I clicked on the Wikipedia article link a few minutes ago, whose preview text stated that the majority of the population is Christian, I found an article stating that the majority of the population is Muslim.

I stated a few minutes ago, because when I went back to confirm just now, the article's text had reverted back to stating Rwanda is a mainly Christian nation.

So, it appears there have been concerted efforts to rewrite history to be more compatible with anti-Islamic sentiment in the UK. Fortunately, Wikipedia seems to itself be quite quick to repair itself from this kind of damage, and the additional sources of information all suggested something was amiss.[^rwanda-demographics]

[^rwanda-demographics]: Note from Claude: According to Rwanda's [Fifth Population and Housing Census conducted in August 2022](https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-report-on-international-religious-freedom/rwanda/), the population is approximately **92% Christian** (40% Roman Catholic, 21% Pentecostal, 15% Protestant, 12% Seventh-day Adventist, 4% other Christian) and only **2% Muslim**. An additional 3% claim no religious affiliation. This confirms the author's observation that Wikipedia vandalism was attempting to falsely portray Rwanda as a majority-Muslim nation during the 2024 UK riots, when in fact [Islam is practiced by a small minority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Rwanda) of Rwandans, the vast majority of whom are Christian.
