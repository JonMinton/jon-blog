*Within this blog I think I've got out of the habit of writing short posts apropos of nothing, so here's an attempt to get back into the habit.* 


Something that's intrigued me over the last few years, perusing the confectionary aisles at newsagents and supermarkets, is the apparent proliferation of the range of Cadbury's Dairy Milk-branded chocolate bars. Looking through the Cadbury's Dairy Milk website [here](https://www.cadbury.co.uk/products/brands/cadbury-dairy-milk/) I can see: 

- Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit & Nut
- Cadbury Dairy Milk
- Cadbury Dairy Milk Caramel
- Cadbury Dairy Milk Mint
- Cadbury Dairy Milk Oreo
- Cadbury Dairy Milk Daim 
- Cadbury Dairy Milk Marvellous Creations Jelly Popping Chocolate Candy Bar
- Cadbury Dairy Milk Wholenut 
- Cadbury Dairy Milk Salted Caramel
- Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruitier and Nuttier
- Cadbury Dairy Milk &more Caramel Nut Crunch
- Cadbury Dairy Milk &more Nutty Praline Crisp
- Cadbury Dairy Milk Crunchie Bits


What intrigues me about this is that, from a marketing perspective, the majority of these chocolate bars are marketed as: 

> Cadbury Dairy Milk, **plus** something extra! 

But at the same time, the weights of the bars all seem to be identical, along with the price: if the standard Dairy Milk bar were 25g, for example, I don't think the Cadbury Dairy Milk Crunchie Bits is 30g: the 25g of the standard Dairy Milk bar, *plus* another 5g of crunchie bits. So, what the other lines of bars offer is actually something like: 

> Cadbury Dairy Milk, *minus* some Cadbury Dairy Milk, *plus* an equal amount of something extra! 

I.e. it's really a *substitution*, which involves both *subtraction* and *addition*. 

So, is a substitution a good thing or a bad thing from the perspective of the customer? From a purely economic perspective, I guess the answer depends - so long as the price of the good isn't changed - on whether what's taken away as part of the substitution is worth more or less than what it's replaced by. 

Now, I can't be bothered trying to work out the materials costs of what the subtracted chocolate is being replaced with, but according to the website tradingeconomics.com, [here's how the trade price of cocoa has changed over the last decade](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/cocoa):

So, almost regardless of what's been *added* to the chocolate bars, it seems likely that it costs Cadbury's *less* than the chocolate that's been taken away from the bars!

In the marketing psychology book [Alchemy: The Surprising Power of Ideas that Don't Make Sense](https://www.wob.com/en-gb/books/rory-sutherland/alchemy/9780753556504?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzby1BhCQARIsAJ_0t5MeyPDVUjIZz6Rplc1L1CWt5CSEmm-Ln-bdzRAvUQuZdmhkws7jGD4aAgHeEALw_wcB#GOR009874703), advertising guru Rory Sutherland makes the distinction between what's *logical*, and what's *psycho-logical*. Of course, *logically*, it doesn't make sense to conflate subtraction with addition. But *psycho-logically*, for Cadbury Dairy Milk, it seems to make perfect sense!
