I've finally got around to 'optimising the Quarto blog for Twitter', by following the guidance in [this section](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-tools.html#twitter-cards) of Quarto's website and adding the following declaration to the `_quarto.yml` file in the project root.

``` yaml
website:
  twitter-card:
   site: "@jonminton"
```

However, is Twitter optimised for Twitter, these days? Is Twitter even Twitter!?
