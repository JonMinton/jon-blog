Alongside eliciting a sense of incipient dread that I may be witnessing the birth of an alien superintelligence, I've recently found Claude AI highly effective at producing visual guides for conveying important technical concepts based on instructions I provide. Following up from a few weeks ago, [where I co-produced a guide for understanding version control by analogy to rock climbing](../version-control-as-rock-climbing/git_climbing_guide.html),[^1] here are a couple of animated guides I've co-produced for trying to convey some simple, but fundamental, concepts in statistics. 

Firstly, an animated guide into how a data get summarised into a distribution, and the distribution into point and interval estimates.

Secondly, a simple guide into how (one sided) p values follow simply from estimating the proportion of such distributions that falls one side or another of a line:

Though there's a great deal I could write about the experience of co-producing pedagogic artefacts with Claude, for now I'm presenting the artefacts as-is, and hope they're interesting and useful for clarifying and embedding these core statistical concepts!
