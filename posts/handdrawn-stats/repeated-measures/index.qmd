I recently acquired a [Remarkable Pro](https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-paper/pro),[^remarkable-pro] which for better or worse allows me to hand write and hand draw stuff for this blog, unconstrained by the dimensions of a physical page, and instantly turn those pages into images which I can put here.

[^remarkable-pro]: Note from Claude: The [reMarkable Paper Pro](https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-paper/pro) was announced on September 4, 2024. It features an 11.8" color Canvas Display, 12ms writing latency, 2-week battery life, and 64GB storage. The device is 5.1mm thin and weighs 1.16 lbs. TIME Magazine named it one of the [Best Inventions of 2025](https://time.com/collections/best-inventions-2025/7318486/remarkable-paper-pro/) for its paper-like writing experience and color E Ink technology. 

Here's what I've written about using random intercepts modelling for repeated measures data. (If there's sufficient/any interest I'll start tidying this up and converting some sections from handwriting to text.)
