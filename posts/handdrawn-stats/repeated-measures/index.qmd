I recently acquired a [Remarkable Pro](https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-paper/pro), which for better or worse allows me to hand write and hand draw stuff for this blog, unconstrained by the dimensions of a physical page, and instantly turn those pages into images which I can put here. 

Here's what I've written about using random intercepts modelling for repeated measures data. (If there's sufficient/any interest I'll start tidying this up and converting some sections from handwriting to text.)
