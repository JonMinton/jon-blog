## Introduction 

Collaborative version control, with git and GitHub, is the coders' **Big Little Secret**. It offers a set of tools and approaches to working securely, safely and collaboratively with others (including one's past self) on complex projects that is *potentially* very transferrable to almost any kind of knowledge work that involves writing stuff down. (So, pretty much anything office-based.) Not just transferrable to other kinds of knowledge work, but potentially *transformative*. 

The git/GitHub collaborative version control pattern isn't coders' **Big Little Secret** because coders *want* it to be a secret, however. Instead, it's because collaborative version control, through git and GitHub, is *fundamentally weird*, inherently *arcane*, unintuitive, difficult to 'grok'. 

For years, I've been trying to work out some more intuitive ways to explain git/GitHub. And now, below, with the embarassingly sizeable help of Claude Sonnet 4.5, I think I might have it: **Git/GitHub as rock climbing**. 

*Enjoy*
