I mentioned in some links to [my previous post on factor analysis with ordinal variables](../factor-analysis-ordinal-variables-analogue/index.qmd) that there's a link between the approach detailed there, and the approach used to construct standardised aptitude and knowledge tests. In some ways the testing example is even simpler than the introductory example. Here are my notes about how it seems to work:[^1]
