A few weeks ago I saw Mickey 17 at the local cinema. It's a fantastically frustrating colloid of a film, combining some extremely interested philosophical and sociological concepts with some characterisattions and performances that lack the verisimilitude of cartoon characters, and tiresome plot beats and action spectacles that seem the cost of doing business when producing a sci-fi film above a certain budget. The filmy separation between the profound and the ridiculous usually being Mark Ruffalo's face. Ruffulo's performances seem to channel Austen Powers era Mike Myers, but lack both Myers charisma nor self-awareness, and his every moment on screen caused my toes to curl and my perception of time to dilute towards infinity.

Setting aside the terrible aspects of the film - and I *am* trying to - at heart Mickey 17 follows some fascinating premises into some interesting places. In Mickey 17 a two-part solution to mortality has been invented. Bodies, and minds, can now be recorded and reproduced with perfect allacrity, the bodies manufactured by 3D bioprinters, the minds and memories constantly backed up and downloaded to newly fabricated bodies whenever the last living body happens to expire. Because of this new technology, nobody need ever die ever again. 

So far, so sci-fi-standard-fare. What are Star Trek's teleporters, for example, but mechanisms for making replicates of recently existng bodies and minds, albeit with the thrice coupled technology of perfect annihilation of the body in the original location - so as to skim over most of the awkward dilemmas and paradoxes raised by such a device? 

Where Mickey 17 departs from the usual cliches, however, is in exploring the sociological ripples such a technology might produce. After initial enthusiasm, Humanity quickly turns hostile on the technology, its uses, and potential for abuse. The legal ramifications of certain edge cases - such as who might be criminally liable when two or more copies of an individual are fabricated and coterminously exist - are judged too head-spinningly confusing, and so this existence-shattering Pandora's Box, the solution to death itself, is by consensus and agreement firmly shut again, almost everywhere that humans call their home. 

Almost, but not completely. There are some people for whom, and some places where, immortality is still permitted. Neither the places nor the people are envied. The places are the rough edges of civilisation; the people: the unerclass of these inhospitable frontiers. 

Because, in Mickey 17, immortality is a *curse*, something only the indigent and desperate would ever agree to be exposed to. The title character, Mickey (or Mickey 1, perhaps), is deep in debt, and the creditors are impatient, violent, sadistic gangsters. Mickey needs money, and needs to be gone, and so volunteers to work on an advance party being assembled to settle a newly discovered ice planet. Each party member's station on the ship and colony will be an exaggerated variant of their station at home. Mickey, with less than nothing on Earth will therefore have less than nothing many times over in the colony.

What does this look like? Well, Mickey signs a contract, to work the dirtiest and most dangerous jobs that need to be done, jobs so nasty, and so dangerous, than no one else will touch. Worse: not event death is considered a valid excusal from fulfilling the terms of the contract in full. If (when) Mickey dies, he's simply reprinted and told to go back to work tomorrow. In the universe of Mickey 17, from from being a profoundly positive development, the solution to death has becomes a means of inventing something like the dalit class from the Indian caste system, and combining this with intentured servitude, creating opportunities for debt bondage so inescapable that even death itself cannot break it. 

Though little is made in the film of this association, in Mickey 17 the value of a life seems to be determined by the laws of supply and demand. When life is finite and death is final, life is valuable and precious. By contrast, for the Immortal Space Dalits, for whom life is plentiful and death merely an inconvenience, life is very cheap and so very unimportant. Like any other commodity, therefore, the value of a life falls as its supply increases, such as to become worthless once its supply becomes infinite. 

Skip forward from this premise one or two hours (to reiterate, time dilates whenever Mark Ruffalo starts chewing scenery) and the film ends. A social revolution has occurred on the colony, and Mickey regains his humanity. How? (**SPOILER ALERT**) By pressing down on a plunger that destroy's the one remaining replicator, and with this his curse of immortality. Mickey, like everyone else, now has just one life, one precious and finite life, and commits to live it as best as he can.
