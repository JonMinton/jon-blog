[Previously I wrote](../no-longer-understanding/index.qmd) about how the main logo, ident or icon for the Stand comedy club in Glasgow and Edinburgh - a goofy child cowboy - became altered in a way that makes it politer, on the one hand, but symbolically meaningless, on the other. A bit like the British Petroleum rebranding as **BP**, and then declaring that these two letters now no longer stand for anything, the Stand's goofy cowboy is still around, but in a sense no longer performs. 

Anyway, walking around Edinburgh yesterday I chanced upon a little more background on the ident, the artist who painted it, and the fated juxtaposition that led the club to disarm the boy:

(I'd suggest it *seemed* like a great visual analogy for the performance of stand-up because it *is*.)

Anyway, now we know, and if you head to St Andrew Square Garden you can see this the giant poster, with much larger images, for yourself. 

The QR code in the bottom right also works, and links to [Mac's webpage here](https://www.tdmacgregor.com/)
