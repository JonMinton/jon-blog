# Footnote Addition Decisions

## Decision Criteria

**ADD footnotes when:**
- Post makes factual/scientific claims that can be verified/updated
- Post references research that has developed since publication
- Post makes predictions that can be evaluated
- Related concepts/research would genuinely add value

**SKIP footnotes when:**
- Pure commentary/opinion pieces
- Humorous/satirical posts
- Posts already have extensive citations
- Technical tutorials (GLM series) - these are educational content
- No clear value-add from external verification

## Posts Reviewed - Batch 1 (Pilot + Recent)

### ✅ Added Footnotes

1. **unattended-deaths** (2 footnotes) - Epidemiological research validation
2. **psycho-logical-arithmetic** (1 footnote) - Cocoa price prediction validated
3. **x-minute-neighbourhoods** (1 footnote) - Walkability research evidence
4. **analytical-maxim-gun** (1 footnote) - Historical verification of Maxim gun
5. **tolerating-intolerance-paradox** (1 footnote) - Link to Popper's paradox
6. **brian-may-gentleman-ecoscientist** (1 footnote) - Controversy/follow-up on documentary

**Subtotal: 6 posts, 7 footnotes**

### ⏭️ Skipped (Good Reasons)

1. **rwanda-information-warfare** - Documenting real-time misinformation, value is in observation
2. **voter-types** - Theoretical framework, no factual claims to verify
3. **circular-reasoning** - Humorous political geometry, satirical
4. **threw-missiles** - Linguistic commentary, no factual verification needed

**Subtotal: 4 posts skipped**

## Posts To Review - Remaining ~121 posts

### Priority Categories

**High Priority (substantive factual claims):**
- Epidemiology/health posts
- Economic/social science posts
- Historical/cultural analysis
- Scientific topics (evolution, ecology, etc.)

**Medium Priority:**
- Commentary with some factual basis
- Book/media reviews with verifiable claims

**Low Priority (likely skip):**
- GLM series (25+ posts) - Technical tutorials
- Hand-drawn statistics - Visual explanations
- Tardy Tuesday - Data visualization exercises
- Pure opinion pieces
- Meta/blog infrastructure posts

## Efficiency Strategy

Given 131 total posts, estimated breakdown:
- GLM series: ~30 posts (SKIP - technical tutorials)
- Hand-drawn/Tardy Tuesday: ~15 posts (SKIP - visual/exercise content)
- Meta/infrastructure: ~10 posts (SKIP)
- **Substantive posts for review: ~70 posts**

Target: 1-2 footnotes per substantive post = **70-140 total footnotes**
Current: 7 footnotes completed
Remaining: **~63-133 footnotes**
