This page lists all posts I've written on statistical modelling and inference, originally framed around 'generalised linear models' (`glm` in R) but quite a bit broader than that. I consider the production of this material something of a public service. More on the background to the series, which includes my own background, is available in [this post here](posts/background-to-my-stats-series/index.qmd).
