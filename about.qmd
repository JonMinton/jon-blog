Hi, I'm Jon. I'm interested in epidemiology, data science, cities, population structure, software development, R, javascript, python, the two cultures, cats, pop culture, storytelling and ideology, irrational rationality, taking dumb things seriously (and vice versa), cooking, and cats. 
Welcome to my Quarto blog, which I started in late 2023.
