    "text": "Trends in R98/R99 deaths since 1990\n\n\nWhat does it mean when someone dies, and no one notices for days, weeks, or months on end?\nThe bodies, once found, will be decomposed to such an extent that no effective autopsy can be performed, and so no cause of death can be identified. Such deaths are then likely to be coded either as R98 (‘Unattended death’) or R99 (‘Other ill-defined and unknown causes of mortality’). Far from being ‘junk codes’, wouldn’t a sudden and sustained change in deaths coded this way (absent an obvious explanation, such as a change in coding practice) signal that something broader is afoot?\nWorking with Lu Hiam, an Oxford PhD student and former GP, and Theodore Estrin-Serlui, a histopathologist, I analysed trends in deaths with these codes, as compared with mortality trends overall in England & Wales.\nSuch codes are rarely used, but in England & Wales they sadly became many times more common over the 1990s and 2000s. Standardised mortality rates in the R98/R99 category became more than three and a half times a common between 1990 and 2010, even as general standardised mortality rates fell by around a third.\nFor every body found so decomposed that the R98/R99 category had to be used, there are usually many more that have been unattended for a few days, have started to decompose, but for which autopsy can still be successfully performed. If these deaths are the tip of the iceberg, the base of this iceberg may be a growing epidemic of loneliness and social isolation, of ever more people with connections to friends and family, with no one to turn to in times of crisis.\nOur paper, A Deathly Silence, has been published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, and received press coverage from a number of outlets."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Yesterday I had the great privilege of being one of two speakers at the Edinburgh R Users group, called EdinbR. (Difficult to say without sounding like a pirate.)\nI spoke through some of the modelling and conceptual challenges involved in trying to model the effect that various drivers/factors/exposures have on how many people in the UK become economically inactive, especially economically inactive for reasons of long-term sickness.\nThe talk seemed to go well (though perhaps the speaker’s always the last person qualified to judge), even though some of the algebra didn’t render correctly. (Which unfortunately means I also used algebra.)\nLike this blog, the presentation also made use of Quarto, but in the presentation’s case using reveal.js.\nThe presentation is available, for those intrepid souls interested in seeing something with R code and algebra, here."
