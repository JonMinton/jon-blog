The relationship information they contain poses some interesting challenges and opportunities. I (Jon), foolishly and/or sadistically, suggested trying to build a recursive algorithm which, given a given package, traces out the other packages that either depends on it, or that it depends on. \n\nWe didn't quite get where we were hoping to, but hopefully in this post I'll be able to unpack some of the challenges and opportunities this approach could bring.\n\nUnlike most tidy tuesday challenges, my (horrible) suggestion brought us into the land of computer science, rather than the data science challenges that most tidy tuesday sessions tend to be focused on. Rather than cover what we did and didn't achieve in that session, this post is largely my attempt to think through the challenge of building and developing a recursive function in R for allowing us to trace through a tree starting from a given node. The post isn't intended to *solve* the challenge I initially suggested, but to lay out some of the conceptual groundwork required to do so later. \n\n## Recursion as a concept \n\nA [recursive function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursive-functions/) is a function that conditionally evokes itself. It's a beautiful and horrifying idea -  coding Inception - and as the link above suggests is often used when a more complex problem needs to be broken down into ever smaller steps. The fifth example in the above link says that it's great for exploring and parsing tree and graph structures. And indeed that's the kind of application I was thinking about when I saw the TidyTuesday dataset. \n\nI've only found reason to build a recursive algorithm in R once before, perhaps around a decade ago. My problem was that I had a two dimensional regular matrix of values, but some of the cells contained missing values. I wanted to build a function that, for any missing value in the matrix, would impute a value for the missing cell given the average of the values in the eight cells that surrounded it, something known as a [Moore Neighbourhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood). The Wikipedia example image used is as follows:\n\n![Moore Neighbourhood](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Moore_neighborhood_with_cardinal_directions.svg/1920px-Moore_neighborhood_with_cardinal_directions.svg.png)\n\nIf each missing cell $C$ was surrounded only by non-missing cells, then there would have been no need for recursion. However there were examples in the data where two or more *contiguous*/neighbouring cells cells were missing. I used recursion to solve this problem by calling the imputation function on any missing neighbours (Say $NE$) of the missing target cell $C$. The missing neighbour cell would then become the new target cell $C$, and if any of this target cell's neighbours were missing, then the imputation function would be called once again, with the last stage's neighbour cell now the new target cell. Only if the condition that a target cell has no missing neighbours would the imputation function actually impute. \n\nIn effect, this use of recursion meant that, for a *patch* of missing cells, the imputation would occur *outside-to-inside*, i.e. from the cell with the most non-missing neighbours to the cell with the fewest. \n\nAnyway, with that example in mind, let's look at the data.\n\n## Loading the data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.6\n✔ forcats   1.0.1     ✔ stringr   1.6.0\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.2.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidytuesdayR)\n\ndta_list <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 16)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n---- Compiling #TidyTuesday Information for 2024-04-16 ----\n--- There are 2 files available ---\n\n\n── Downloading files ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n  1 of 2: \"shiny_revdeps.csv\"\n  2 of 2: \"package_details.csv\"\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: One or more parsing issues, call `problems()` on your data frame for details,\ne.g.:\n  dat <- vroom(...)\n  problems(dat)\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndta_main <- dta_list$shiny_revdeps\ndta_main\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 146,135 × 3\n   child              dependency_type parent\n   <chr>              <chr>           <chr> \n 1 AFheritability     depends         shiny \n 2 AMPLE              depends         shiny \n 3 animalEKF          depends         shiny \n 4 bde                depends         shiny \n 5 BDP2               depends         shiny \n 6 BoneProfileR       depends         shiny \n 7 clinDR             depends         shiny \n 8 CLME               depends         shiny \n 9 cocktailApp        depends         shiny \n10 competitiontoolbox depends         shiny \n# ℹ 146,125 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOf course we didn't notice the dataset was focused on shiny! \n\n## Exploration\n\nWhat are the types of dependency listed?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nunique(dta_main$dependency_type)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"depends\"   \"imports\"   \"suggests\"  \"linkingto\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo, where the parent is shiny, how many types of each dependency are there?

At the outer level there is a list of length three. \n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBroadly, it appears the information contained in the list structures would allow the tree structure to be recovered. However, currently no trace returned is of length greater than 2. Before applying a recursive algorithm to the real data, more work should probably be done on defining exactly what type of output should be returned, and then implementing this return type. However, the function does appear to use recursion effectively, delving into various tree structures until roots of the trees are found, rather than either just stopping at an arbitrary depth, or never stopping and evaluating. \n",
