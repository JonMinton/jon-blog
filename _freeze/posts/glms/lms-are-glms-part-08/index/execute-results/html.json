We covered the concept that *information* and *uncertainty* are inversely related: the more information we have, the less uncertain we are, and vice versa. We estimated parameter uncertainty around the point that maximised (log) likelihood by asking the algorithm to take small steps from this highest point in different directions (dimensions, in effect variables), and report how steep the fall is in different directions. Steeper falls along a dimension imply less uncertainty and so more more information and narrower confidence intervals; as usual, the converse is also true. The component returned by `optim()` which reports the results of this 'stepping out' is a square matrix called the Hessian, which can be inverted to produce estimates of the variances and covarainces of each of the parameters being estimated in our model. \n\n## Aim\n\nThe aims of this post are to show how estimates of uncertainty around the point estimates produced from the Hessian, based around the curvature measured around the point of maximum likelihood, are similar to those produced using a much more extensive (and computationally intensive) interrogation of the likelihood surface using a grid-search approach. It will also show how representations of joint uncertainty for parameter values can be generated using the multivariate normal distribution. \n\n## Comparing inferred and observed likelihood surfaces\n\nLet's return once again to the toy dataset used in the last two posts, whose true parameters we know because we made them up; and also the log likelihood function: \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nllNormal <- function(pars, y, X){\n    beta <- pars[1:ncol(X)]\n    sigma2 <- exp(pars[ncol(X)+1])\n    -1/2 * (sum(log(sigma2) + (y - (X%*%beta))^2 / sigma2))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# set a seed so runs are identical\nset.seed(7)\n# create a main predictor variable vector: -3 to 5 in increments of 1\nx <- (-3):5\n# Record the number of observations in x\nN <- length(x)\n# Create a response variable with variability\ny <- 2.5 + 1.4 * x  + rnorm(N, mean = 0, sd = 0.5)\n\n# bind x into a two column matrix whose first column is a vector of 1s (for the intercept)\n\nX <- cbind(rep(1, N), x)\n# Clean up names\ncolnames(X) <- NULL\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo estract estimates of uncertainty about the uncertainty of each of these parameters, we used `optim()` with the options shown below, and then inverted the matrix to go from information to uncertainty. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfuller_optim_output <- optim(\n    par = c(0, 0, 0), \n    fn = llNormal,\n    method = \"BFGS\",\n    control = list(fnscale = -1),\n    hessian = TRUE,\n    y = y, \n    X = X\n)\n\nfuller_optim_output\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n$par\n[1]  2.460675  1.375424 -1.336438\n\n$value\n[1] 1.51397\n\n$counts\nfunction gradient \n      80       36 \n\n$convergence\n[1] 0\n\n$message\nNULL\n\n$hessian\n              [,1]          [,2]          [,3]\n[1,] -3.424917e+01 -3.424917e+01  2.727840e-05\n[2,] -3.424917e+01 -2.625770e+02 -2.818257e-05\n[3,]  2.727840e-05 -2.818257e-05 -4.500002e+00\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhess <- fuller_optim_output$hessian\ninv_hess <- solve(-hess)\ninv_hess\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n              [,1]          [,2]          [,3]\n[1,]  3.357745e-02 -4.379668e-03  2.309709e-07\n[2,] -4.379668e-03  4.379668e-03 -5.397790e-08\n[3,]  2.309709e-07 -5.397790e-08  2.222221e-01\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe were especially interested in the first two rows and columns of this matrix, as they correspond to uncertainty in $\\beta = \\{ \\beta_0, \\beta_1 \\}$. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninv_hess_betas <- inv_hess[1:2, 1:2]\n\ninv_hess_betas\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n             [,1]         [,2]\n[1,]  0.033577455 -0.004379668\n[2,] -0.004379668  0.004379668\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBack in part five, we used this same dataset to show how the log likelihood varies for various, equally spaced, candidate values for $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ (having fixed $\\eta = \\exp({\\sigma^2})$ at its true value). This led to the followng map of the landscape[^1]\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ncandidate_param_values <- expand_grid(\n    beta_0 = seq(-15, 15, by = 0.05),\n    beta_1 = seq(-15, 15, by = 0.05)\n)\n\nfeed_to_ll <- function(b0, b1){\n    pars <- c(b0, b1, log(0.25))\n    llNormal(pars, y, X)\n}\n\ncandidate_param_values <- candidate_param_values |>\n    mutate(\n        ll = map2_dbl(beta_0, beta_1, feed_to_ll)\n    )\n\ncandidate_param_values |>\n    ggplot(aes(beta_0, beta_1, z = ll)) + \n    geom_contour_filled() + \n    geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +\n    labs(\n        title = \"Log likelihood as a function of possible values of beta_0 and beta_1\",\n        x = \"beta0 (the intercept)\",\n        y = \"beta1 (the slope)\"\n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n[^1]: I've narrowed the space between values slightly, and increased the range of permutations of values to search through, for an even more precise recovery of the likelihood landscape. \n\nWithin the above we can see that the log likelihood landscape for these two parameters looks like a bivariate normal distribution, we can also see a bit of a slant in this normal distribution. This implies a *correlation* between the two candidate values. The direction of the slant is downwards from left to right, implying the correlation is negative. \n\nFirstly let's check that the correlation between $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ implied by the Hessian *is* negative. These are the off-diagonal elements, either first row, second column, or second row, first column:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninv_hess_betas[1,2]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] -0.004379668\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninv_hess_betas[2,1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] -0.004379668\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYes they are!\n\n\nAs mentioned previously, the likelihood surface produced by the gridsearch method involves a lot of computations, so a lot of steps, and likely a lot of trial and error, if it were to be used to try to find the maximum likelihood value for the parameters. By contrast, the `optim()` algorithm typically involves far fewer steps, 'feeling' its way up the hill until it reaches a point where there's nowhere higher. [^2] When it then reaches this highest point, it then 'feels' the curvature around this point in multiple directions, producing the Hessian. The algorithm doesn't *see* the likelihood surface, because it hasn't travelled along most of it. But the Hessian can be used to *infer* the likelihood surface, subject to subject (usually) reasonable assumptions.\n\n[^2]: In practice, the algorithm seeks to minimise the value returned by the function, not maximise it, hence the negative being applied through the argument `fnscale = -1` in the `control` argument. But the principle is identical. \n\nWhat are these (usually) reasonable assumptions? Well, that the likelihood surface can be approximated by a multivariate normal distribution, which is a generalisation of the standard Normal distribution over more than one dimensions.[^3]\n\n[^3]: This means that, whereas the standard Normal returns a single output, the Multivariate Normal returns a vector of outputs, one for each parameter in $\\theta$, which should also be the length of the diagonal (or alternatively either the number of rows or columns) of $\\Sigma$. \n\nWe can use the `mvrnorm` function from the `MASS` package, alongside the point estimates and Hessian from `optim`, in order to produce estimates of $\\theta = \\{ \\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\eta \\}$ which represent reasonable uncertainty about the true values of each of these parameters. Algebraically, this can be expressed as something like the following:\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\theta} \\sim Multivariate Normal(\\mu = \\dot{\\theta}, \\sigma^2 = \\Sigma)\n$$\n\nWhere $\\dot{\\theta}$ are the point estimates from `optim()` and $\\Sigma$ is the implied variance-covariance matrix recovered from the Hessian. \n\nLet's create this MVN model and see what kinds of outputs it produces. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(MASS)\n\npoint_estimates <- fuller_optim_output$par\n\nvcov <- -solve(fuller_optim_output$hessian)\nparam_draws <- MASS::mvrnorm(\n    n = 10000, \n    mu = point_estimates, \n    Sigma = vcov\n)\n\ncolnames(param_draws) <- c(\n    \"beta0\", \"beta1\", \"eta\"\n)\n\nhead(param_draws)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n        beta0    beta1         eta\n[1,] 2.564978 1.375636 -0.30407255\n[2,] 2.440111 1.367774 -1.16815288\n[3,] 2.775332 1.338583 -0.05574937\n[4,] 2.283011 1.481799 -0.26095101\n[5,] 2.695635 1.228565 -1.18369341\n[6,] 2.686818 1.483601 -0.44262363\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see that `mvrnorm()`, with these inputs from `optim()` produces three columns: one for each parameter being estimated $\\{ \\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\eta \\}$. The `n` argumment indicates the number of draws to take; in this case, 10000. This number of draws makes it easier to see how much variation there is in each of the estimates. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_param_draws <- \nparam_draws |>\n    as_tibble(\n        rownames = 'draw'\n    ) |>\n    mutate(\n        sig2 = exp(eta)\n    ) |>\n    pivot_longer(\n        -draw, \n        names_to = \"param\",\n        values_to = \"value\"\n    ) \n    \ndf_param_draws |>\n    ggplot(aes(x = value)) + \n    geom_density() + \n    facet_grid(param ~ .) + \n    geom_vline(xintercept=0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are a number of things to note here: firstly, that the average of the $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ values appear close to their known 'true' values of 2.5 and 1.4 respectively. Secondly, that whereas the $\\eta$ values are normally distributed, the $\\sigma^2$ values derived from them are not, and are never below zero; this is the effect of the exponential link between quantities. Thirdly, that the implied values of $\\sigma^2$ do appear to be centred around `0.25`, as they should be as $\\sigma$ was set to `0.50` in the model. \n\nAnd forthly, that the density around $\\beta_1$ is more peaked than around $\\beta_0$. This concords with what we saw previously in the filled contour map: both the horizontal `beta0` axis and vertical `beta1` axis are on the same scale, but the oval is broader along the horizontal axis than the vertical axis. This in effect implies that we have more information about the true value of $\\beta_1$, the slope, than about the true value of $\\beta_0$, the intercept. \n\nWe can also use these draws to reproduce something similar to, but not identical to, [^4] the previous filled contour map:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# param_draws |>\n#     as_tibble(\n#         rownames = 'draw'\n#     ) |>\n#     ggplot(aes(x = beta0, y = beta1)) + \n#     geom_point(alpha = 0.1) + \n#     coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim = c(-10, 10))\n\nparam_draws |>\n    as_tibble(\n        rownames = 'draw'\n    ) |>\n    ggplot(aes(x = beta0, y = beta1)) + \n    geom_density_2d_filled() + \n    coord_equal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n[^4]: The values will not be identical because the values for $\\eta$, and so $\\sigma^2$, have not been fixed at the true value in this example. \n\nOnce again, we see the same qualities as the contour map produced by interrogating the likelihood surface exhaustively: the distribution appears bivariate normal; there is a greater range in the distribution along the `beta0` than the `beta1` axis; and there is evidence of some negative correlation between the two parameters.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis post has shown how `optim()`, which in its vanilla state only returns point estimates, can be configured to also calculater and report the Hessian, a record of instantaneous curvature around the point estimates. Even without a fine-grained and exhausive search throughout the likelihood surface, this measure of curvature can be used to produce similar measures of uncertainty to the more exhausive approach, in a fraction of the number of computations. \n\nMore importantly, it can be used to generate draws of plausible combinations of parameter values, something denoted as $\\tilde{\\theta}$ earlier. This is something especially useful for producing *honest quantities of interest*, which both tell users of models something they want to know, while also representing how uncertain we are in this knowledge. \n\nWe'll cover that in [the next post...](../lms-are-glms-part-09/index.qmd) [^5]\n\n[^5]: I was expecting to cover it in the current post, but this is probably enough content for now!",
