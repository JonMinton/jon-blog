Both are standardised so they have the same scale.\n\nBut I'm interested in the effects of improving/changing 'health' in general, which is obviously composed of both mental health and physical health, but not measured directly.\n\nAs the two variables are standardised, however, I can model an improvement in health in general as a change in both mental health and physical health concurrently.\n\nHowever, I want to compare like-with-like: scenarios in which the total 'amount' of intervention effect is kept constant, but the relative contribution of the two health components is varied.\n\nThis is where a little trigonometry comes in. [^1] All interventions on the grey unit circle in @fig-circle represent possible scenarios in which the total amount of health change is constant, but where the relative contribution of mental and physical health is varied.\n\n[^1]: People who claim you'll never need trigonometry once you leave school are wrong. It's valuable about once a decade!\n\nThe aim of the scientific illustration is to make this intuition a *bit* clearer to understand!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(geomtextpath)\n\npos_y <- function(x) {sqrt(1 - x^2)}\nx = seq(0, 1, by = 0.001)\ndta <- tibble(\n  x = x\n) |> \n  mutate(\n    y = pos_y(x)\n  )\n\ndta |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + \n    geom_line(color = \"grey\") + \n    coord_equal() + \n    labs(x = \"Physical Health (Standardised)\",\n         y = \"Mental Health (Standardised)\",\n         title = \"Health improvement scenarios modelled\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  annotate(\"point\", x = 1, y = 0) + \n  annotate(\"point\", x = 0, y = 1) + \n  annotate(\"point\", x = 1/ sqrt(2), y = 1/ sqrt(2)) + \n  annotate(\"point\", x =  2 / sqrt(5), y = 1 / sqrt(5)) + \n  annotate(\"point\", x = 1 / sqrt(5), y = 2 / sqrt(5)) + \n  geom_textcurve(\n    data = data.frame(x = 0, y = 0, xend = 0, yend = 1), \n                      mapping = aes(x, y, xend = xend,  yend = yend), \n                      label = \"S1: MH Only\", \n    curvature = 0, hjust = 0.5, arrow = arrow(),\n    vjust = 0.5\n  ) + \n  geom_textcurve(\n    data = data.frame(x = 0, y = 0, xend = 1, yend = 0), \n                      mapping = aes(x, y, xend = xend,  yend = yend), \n                      label = \"S2: PH Only\", \n    curvature = 0, hjust = 0.5, arrow = arrow(),\n    vjust = 0.5\n  ) + \n  geom_textcurve(\n    data = data.frame(x = 0, y = 0, xend = 1/sqrt(2), yend = 1/sqrt(2)), \n                      mapping = aes(x, y, xend = xend,  yend = yend), \n                      label = \"S3: Equal Gain\", \n    curvature = 0, hjust = 0.5, arrow = arrow(),\n    vjust = 0.5\n  ) + \n  geom_textcurve(\n    data = data.frame(x = 0, y = 0, yend = 2/sqrt(5), xend = 1/sqrt(5)), \n                      mapping = aes(x, y, xend = xend,  yend = yend), \n                      label = \"S4: MH Bias\", \n    curvature = 0, hjust = 0.5, arrow = arrow(),\n    vjust = 0.5\n  )  +\n  geom_textcurve(\n    data = data.frame(x = 0, y = 0, yend = 1/sqrt(5), xend = 2/sqrt(5)), \n                      mapping = aes(x, y, xend = xend,  yend = yend), \n                      label = \"S5: PH Bias\", \n    curvature = 0, hjust = 0.5, arrow = arrow(),\n    vjust = 0.5\n  )  \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Modelling various intervention scenarios](index_files/figure-html/fig-circle-1.png){#fig-circle width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
